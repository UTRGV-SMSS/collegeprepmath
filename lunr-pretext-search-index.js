  "body": " Integers   Objective: Add, Subtract, Multiply and Divide Positive and Negative Numbers.   The ability to work comfortably with negative numbers is essential to success in algebra. For this reason we will do a quick review of adding, subtracting, multiplying and dividing of integers. Integers are all the positive whole numbers, zero, and their opposites (negatives). As this is intended to be a review of integers, the descriptions and examples will not be as detailed as a normal lesson.   World View Note: The first set of rules for working with negative numbers was written out by the Indian mathematician Brahmagupa.  When adding integers we have two cases to consider. The first is if the signs match, both positive or both negative. If the signs match we will add the numbers together and keep the sign. This is illustrated in the following examples        If the signs don’t match, one positive and one negative number, we will subtract the numbers (as if they were all positive) and then use the sign from the larger number. This means if the larger number is positive, the answer is positive. If the larger number is negative, the answer is negative. This is shown in the following examples.        For subtraction of negatives we will change the problem to an addition problem which we can then solve using the above methods. The way we change a subtraction to an addition is to add the opposite of the number after the subtraction sign. Often this method is refered to as “add the opposite.” This is illustrated in the following examples.           Multiplication and division of integers both work in a very similar pattern. The short description of the process is we multiply and divide like normal, if the signs match (both positive or both negative) the answer is positive. If the signs don’t match (one positive and one negative) then the answer is negative. This is shown in the following examples              A few things to be careful of when working with integers. First be sure not to confuse a problem like with . The second problem is a multiplication problem because there is nothing between the and the parenthesis. If there is no operation written in between the parts, then we assume that means we are multiplying. The problem, is subtraction because the subtraction separates the from what comes after it. Another item to watch out for is to be careful not to mix up the pattern for adding and subtracting integers with the pattern for multiplying and dividing integers. They can look very similar, for example if the signs match on addition, the we keep the negative, , but if the signs match on multiplication, the answer is positive, .

  "body": " Fractions   Objective: Reduce, add, subtract, multiply, and divide with fractions.   Working with fractions is a very important foundation to algebra. Here we will briefly review reducing, multiplying, dividing, adding, and subtracting fractions. As this is a review, concepts will not be explained in detail as other lessons are.   World View Note: The earliest known use of fraction comes from the Middle Kingdom of Egypt around BC!  We always like our final answers when working with fractions to be reduced. Reducing fractions is simply done by dividing both the numerator and denominator by the same number. This is shown in the following example     The previous example could have been done in one step by dividing both numerator and denominator by . We also could have divided by twice and then divided by once (in any order). It is not important which method we use as long as we continue reducing our fraction until it cannot be reduced any further.  The easiest operation with fractions is multiplication. We can multiply fractions by multiplying straight across, multiplying numerators together and denominators together.     When multiplying we can reduce our fractions before we multiply. We can either reduce vertically with a single fraction, or diagonally with several fractions, as long as we use one number from the numerator and one number from the denominator.     Dividing fractions is very similar to multiplying with one extra step. Dividing fractions requires us to first take the reciprocal of the second fraction and multiply. Once we do this, the multiplication problem solves just as the previous problem     To add and subtract fractions we will first have to find the least common denominator (LCD). There are several ways to find an LCD. One way is to find the smallest multiple of the largest denominator that you can also divide the small denomiator by.        Adding and subtracting fractions is identical in process. If both fractions already have a common denominator we just add or subtract the numerators and keep the denominator.     While can be written as the mixed number , in algebra we will almost never use mixed numbers. For this reason we will always use the improper fraction, not the mixed number.     If the denominators do not match we will first have to identify the LCD and build up each fraction by multiplying the numerators and denominators by the same number so the denominator is built up to the LCD.         Exercises - Fractions    Simplify each. Leave your answer as an improper fraction.                                                     Find each product.

  "title": "Order of Operations",
  "body": " Order of Operations   Objective: Evaluate expressions using the order of operations, including the use of absolute value.   When simplifying expressions it is important that we simplify them in the correct order. Consider the following problem done two different ways:     The previous example illustrates that if the same problem is done two different ways we will arrive at two different solutions. However, only one method can be correct. It turns out the second method, , is the correct method. The order of operations ends with the most basic of operations, addition (or subtraction). Before addition is completed we must do repeated addition or multiplication (or division). Before multiplication is completed we must do repeated multiplication or exponents. When we want to do something out of order and make it come first we will put it in parenthesis (or grouping symbols). This list then is our order of operations we will use to simplify expressions.     Order of Operations    Parenthesis (Grouping)    Exponents    Multiply and Divide (Left to Right)    Add and Subtract (Left to Right)     Multiply and Divide are on the same level because they are the same operation (division is just multiplying by the reciprocal). This means they must be done left to right, so some problems we will divide first, others we will multiply first. The same is true for adding and subtracting (subtracting is just adding the opposite).  Often students use the word PEMDAS to remember the order of operations, as the first letter of each operation creates the word PEMDAS . However, it is the author’s suggestion to think about PEMDAS as a vertical word written as: P E MD AS so we don’t forget that multiplication and division are done left to right (same with addition and subtraction). Another way students remember the order of operations is to think of a phrase such as “Please Excuse My Dear Aunt Sally” where each word starts with the same letters as the order of operations start with.   World View Note: The first use of grouping symbols are found in in the Dutch mathematician, Franciscus van Schooten’s text, Vieta. He used a bar over the expression that is to be evaluated first. So problems like were written as .     It is very important to remember to multiply and divide from from left to right!     In the previous example, if we had multiplied first, five would have been the answer which is incorrect.  If there are several parenthesis in a problem we will start with the inner most parenthesis and work our way out. Inside each parenthesis we simplify using the order of operations as well. To make it easier to know which parenthesis goes with which parenthesis, different types of parenthesis will be used such as and and , these parenthesis all mean the same thing, they are parenthesis and must be evaluated first.     As the above example illustrates, it can take several steps to complete a problem. The key to successfully solve order of operations problems is to take the time to show your work and do one step at a time. This will reduce the chance of making a mistake along the way.  There are several types of grouping symbols that can be used besides parenthesis. One type is a fraction bar. If we have a fraction, the entire numerator and the entire denominator must be evaluated before we reduce the fraction. In these cases we can simplify in both the numerator and denominator at the same time.     Another type of grouping symbol that also has an operation with it, absolute value. When we have absolute value we will evaluate everything inside the absolute value, just as if it were a normal parenthesis. Then once the inside is completed we will take the absolute value, or distance from zero, to make the number positive.     The above example also illustrates an important point about exponents. Exponents only are considered to be on the number they are attached to. This means when we see , only the is squared, giving us or . But when the negative is in parentheses, such as the negative is part of the number and is also squared giving us a positive solution, .

  "body": " Properties of Algebra   Objective: Simplify algebraic expressions by substituting given values, distributing, and combining like terms.   In algebra we will often need to simplify an expression to make it easier to use. There are three basic forms of simplifying which we will review here.   World View Note: The term \"Algebra\" comes from the Arabic word al-jabr which means \"reunion\". It was first used in Iraq in AD by Mohammad ibnMusa al-Khwarizmi.  The first form of simplifying expressions is used when we know what number each variable in the expression represents. If we know what they represent we can replace each variable with the equivalent number and simplify what remains using order of operations.     Whenever a variable is replaced with something, we will put the new number inside a set of parenthesis. Notice the and in the previous example are in parenthesis. This is to preserve operations that are sometimes lost in a simple replacement. Sometimes the parenthesis won’t make a difference, but it is a good habbit to always use them to prevent problems later.     It will be more common in our study of algebra that we do not know the value of the variables. In this case, we will have to simplify what we can and leave the variables in our final solution. One way we can simplify expressions is to combine like terms. Like terms are terms where the variables match exactly (exponents included). Examples of like terms would be and or and or and . If we have like terms we are allowed to add (or subtract) the numbers in front of the variables, then keep the variables the same. This is shown in the following examples        As we combine like terms we need to interpret subtraction signs as part of the following term. This means if we see a subtraction sign, we treat the following term like a negative term, the sign always stays with the term.  A final method to simplify is known as distributing. Often as we work with problems there will be a set of parenthesis that make solving a problem difficult, if not impossible. To get rid of these unwanted parenthesis we have the distributive property. Using this property we multiply the number in front of the parenthesis by each term inside of the parenthesis.   Distributive Property:   Several examples of using the distributive property are given below.        In the previous example we again use the fact that the sign goes with the number, this means we treat the as a negative number, this gives , a positive number. The most common error in distributing is a sign error, be very careful with your signs!  It is possible to distribute just a negative through parenthesis. If we have a negative in front of parenthesis we can think of it like a in front and distribute the through. This is shown in the following example.     Distributing through parenthesis and combining like terms can be combined into one problem. Order of operations tells us to multiply (distribute) first then add or subtract last (combine like terms). Thus we do each problem in two steps, distribute then combine.        In the previous example we distributed , not just . This is because we will always treat subtraction like a negative sign that goes with the number after it. This makes a big difference when we multiply by the inside the parenthesis, we now have a positive answer. Following are more involved examples of distributing and combining like terms.

  "title": "One Step Equations",
  "body": " One Step Equations   Objective: Solve one step linear equations by balancing using inverse operations  Solving linear equations is an important and fundamental skill in algebra. In algebra, we are often presented with a problem where the answer is known, but part of the problem is missing. The missing part of the problem is what we seek to find. An example of such a problem is shown below.     Notice the above problem has a missing part, or unknown, that is marked by . If we are given that the solution to this equation is , it could be plugged into the equation, replacing the with . This is shown in the next example.     Now the equation comes out to a true statement! Notice also that if another number, for example, , was plugged in, we would not get a true statement as seen in the next example.    Since this is not a true statement, this demonstrates that is not the solution. However, depending on the complexity of the problem, this “guess and check” method is not very efficient. Thus, we take a more algebraic approach to solving equations. Here we will focus on what are called “one-step equations” or equations that only require one step to solve. While these equations often seem very fundamental, it is important to master the pattern for solving these problems so we can solve more complex problems.   Addition Problems  To solve equations, the general rule is to do the opposite. For example, consider the following example.     Then we get our solution, . The same process is used in each of the following examples.   Addition Examples        Subtraction Problems  In a subtraction problem, we get rid of negative numbers by adding them to both sides of the equation. For example, consider the following example.     Then we get our solution . The same process is used in each of the following examples. Notice that each time we are getting rid of a negative number by adding.   Subtraction Examples        Multiplication Problems  With a multiplication problem, we get rid of the number by dividing on both sides. For example, consider the following example.     With multiplication problems it is very important that care is taken with signs. If is multiplied by a negative, then we will divide by a negative. This is shown in the next example.     The same process is used in each of the following examples. Notice how negative and positive numbers are handled as each problem is solved.   Multiplication Examples        Division Problems:  In division problems, we get rid of the denominator by multiplying on both sides. For example consider our next example     Then we get our solution . The same process is used in each of the following examples.   Division Examples        The process described above is fundamental to solving equations. once this process is mastered, the problems we will see have several more steps. These problems may seem more complex, but the process and patterns used will remain the same.   World View Note: The study of algebra originally was called the “Cossic Art” from the Latin, the study of “things” (which we now call variables).    Exercises - One Step Equations    Solve each equation.

  "body": " Two-Step Equations   Objective: Solve two-step equations by balancing and using inverse operations.   After mastering the technique for solving equations that are simple one-step equations, we are ready to consider two-step equations. As we solve two-step equations, the important thing to remember is that everything works backwards! When working with one-step equations, we learned that in order to clear a “plus five” in the equation, we would subtract five from both sides. We learned that to clear “divided by seven” we multiply by seven on both sides. The same pattern applies to the order of operations. When solving for our variable x, we use order of operations backwards as well. This means we will add or subtract first, then multiply or divide second (then exponents, and finally any parentheses or grouping symbols, but that’s another lesson). So, to solve the equation in the first example,     We have two numbers on the same side as the x. We need to move the and the to the other side. We know to move the four we need to divide, and to move the twenty we will add twenty to both sides. If order of operations is done backwards, we will add or subtract first. Therefore, we will add 0 to both sides first. Once we are done with that, we will divide both sides by . The steps are shown below     Notice in our next example when we replace the with we get a true statement.     The same process is used to solve any two-step equations. Add or subtract first, then multiply or divide. Consider our next example and notice how the same process is applied.     Notice the seven subtracted out completely! Many students get stuck on this point, do not forget that we have a number for “nothing left” and that number is zero. With this in mind the process is almost identical to our first example.  A common error student make with two-step equations is with negative signs. Remember the sign always stays with the number. Consider the following example     The same is true even if there is no coefficient in front of the variable. Consider the next example     Solving two-step equations is a very important skill to master, as we study algebra. The first step is to add or subtract, the second is to multiply or divide. This pattern is seen in each of the following examples.   Two-Step Equation Examples       As problems in algebra become more complex the process covered here will remain the same. In fact, as we solve problems like those in the next example, each one of them will have several steps to solve, but the last two steps are a twostep equation like we are solving here. This is why it is very important to master two-step equations now!      World View Note: Persian mathematician Omar Khayyam would solve algebraic problems geometrically by intersecting graphs rather than solving them algebraically.

Often as we are solving linear equations, we will need to do some work to set them up into a form we are familiar with solving. This section will focus on manipulating an equation we are asked to solve in such a way that we can use our pattern for solving two-step equations to ultimately arrive at the solution.  One such issue that needs to be addressed is parenthesis. Often the parenthesis can get in the way of solving an otherwise easy problem. As you might expect we can get rid of the unwanted parenthesis by using the distributive property. This is shown in the following example. Notice the first step is distributing, then it is solved like any other two-step equation.     Often after we distribute there will be some like terms on one side of the equation. The next example shows distributing to clear the parenthesis and then combining like terms next. Notice we only combine like terms on the same side of the equation. Once we have done this, our next example solves just like any other two-step equation.     A second type of problem that becomes a two-step equation after a bit of work is one where we see the variable on both sides. This is shown in the following example.     Notice here the is on both the left and right sides of the equation. This can make it difficult to decide which side to work with. We fix this by moving one of the terms with x to the other side, much like we moved a constant term. It doesn’t matter which term gets moved, or , however, it would be the author’s suggestion to move the smaller term (to avoid negative coefficients). For this reason, we begin this problem by clearing the positive by subtracting from both sides.     The previous example shows the check on this solution. Here the solution is plugged into the on both the left and right sides before simplifying.     The next example illustrates the same process with negative coefficients. Notice first the smaller term with the variable is moved to the other side, this time by adding because the coefficient is negative.     Linear equations can become particularly interesting when the two processes are combined. In the following problems we have parenthesis and the variable on both sides. Notice in each of the following examples we distribute, then combine like terms, then move the variable to one side of the equation     Sometimes we may have to distribute more than once to clear several parentheses. Remember to combine like terms after you distribute!     This leads to a -step process to solve any linear equation. While all five steps aren’t always needed, this can serve as a guide to solving equations.  Distribute through any parentheses.  Combine like terms on each side of the equation.  Get the variables on one side by adding or subtracting.  Solve the remaining -step equation (add or subtract then multiply or divide).  Check your answer by plugging it back in for to find a true statement.  The order of these steps is very important.   World View Note: The Chinese developed a method for solving equations that involved finding each digit one at a time about years ago!  We can see each of the above five steps worked through our next example.   Check:   When we check our solution of we found a true statement, . Therefore, we know our solution is the correct solution for the problem.  There are two special cases that can come up as we are solving these linear equations. The first is illustrated in the next two examples. Notice we start by distributing and moving the variables all to the same side.     Here the variable subtracted out completely! We are left with a true statement, . If the variables subtract out completely and we are left with a true statement, this indicates that the equation is always true, no matter what $x$ is. Thus, for our solution we say all real numbers or .     Again, the variable subtracted out completely! However, this time we are left with a false statement, this indicates that the equation is never true, no matter what is. Thus, for our solution we say no solution or .

  "body": " Solving with Fractions   Objective: Solve linear equations with rational coefficients by multiplying by the least common denominator to clear the fractions.   Often when solving linear equations, we will need to work with an equation with fraction coefficients. We can solve these problems as we have in the past. This is demonstrated in our next example.    Notice we will need to get a common denominator to add . Notice we have a common denominator of . So we build up the denominator, , and we can now add the fractions:   We can get rid of by dividing both sides by . Dividing by a fraction is the same as multiplying by the reciprocal, so we will multiply both sides by .    While this process does help us arrive at the correct solution, the fractions can make the process quite difficult. This is why we have an alternate method for dealing with fractions - clearing fractions. Clearing fractions is nice as it gets rid of the fractions for the majority of the problem. We can easily clear the fractions by finding the LCD and multiplying each term by the LCD. This is shown in the next example, the same problem as our first example, but this time we will solve by clearing fractions.     The next example illustrates this as well. Notice the fraction in the original equation, but to solve it we put the over to make it a fraction.     We can use this same process if there are parenthesis in the problem. We will first distribute the coefficient in front of the parenthesis, then clear the fractions. This is seen in the following example.     While the problem can take many different forms, the pattern to clear the fraction is the same, after distributing through any parentheses we multiply each term by the LCD and reduce. This will give us a problem with no fractions that is much easier to solve. The following example again illustrates this process.

  "body": " Formulas   Objective: Solve linear formulas for a given variable.   Solving formulas is much like solving general linear equations. The only difference is we will have several variables in the problem, and we will be attempting to solve for one specific variable. For example, we may have a formula such as (formula for surface area of a right circular cone) and we may be interested in solving for the variable s. This means we want to isolate the s so the equation has s on one side, and everything else on the other. So a solution might look like . This second equation gives the same information as the first, they are algebraically equivalent, however, one is solved for the area, while the other is solved for s (slant height of the cone). In this section we will discuss how we can move from the first equation to the second.  When solving formulas for a variable we need to focus on the one variable we are trying to solve for, all the others are treated just like numbers. This is shown in the following example. Two parallel problems are shown, the first is a normal one-step equation, the second is a formula that we are solving for .     We use the same process to solve for as we use to solve for . Because we are solving for we treat all the other variables the same way we would treat numbers. Thus, to get rid of the multiplication we divided by . This same idea is seen in the following example.     As and are not like terms, they cannot be combined. For this reason, we leave the expression as . This same one-step process can be used with grouping symbols.     Because is in parenthesis, if we are not searching for what is inside the parenthesis, we can keep them together as a group and divide by that group. However, if we are searching for what is inside the parenthesis, we will have to break up the parenthesis by distributing. The following example is the same formula, but this time we will solve for .     Be very careful as we isolate x that we do not try and cancel the on top and bottom of the fraction. This is not allowed if there is any adding or subtracting in the fraction. There is no reducing possible in this problem, so our final reduced answer remains . The next example is another two-step problem.     It is important to note that we know we are done with the problem when the variable we are solving for is isolated or alone on one side of the equation and it does not appear anywhere on the other side of the equation.  The next example is also a two-step equation, it is the problem we started with at the beginning of the lesson.     Again, we cannot reduce the in the numerator and denominator because of the subtraction in the problem. Formulas often have fractions in them and can be solved in much the same way we solved with fractions before. First identify the LCD and then multiply each term by the LCD. After we reduce there will be no more fractions in the problem so we can solve like any general equation from there.     The same pattern can be seen when we have several fractions in our problem.     Depending on the context of the problem we may find a formula that uses the same letter, one capital, one lowercase. These represent different values and we must be careful not to combine a capital variable with a lower-case variable.     Notice the and were not combined as like terms. This is because a formula will often use a capital letter and lower-case letter to represent different variables. Often with formulas there is more than one way to solve for a variable. The next example solves the same problem in a slightly different manner. After clearing the denominator, we divide by to move it to the other side, rather than distributing.     Both answers to the last two examples are correct, they are just written in a different form because we solved them in different ways. This is very common with formulas, there may be more than one way to solve for a variable, yet both are equivalent and correct.   World View Note: The father of algebra, Persian mathematician Muhammad ibn Musa Khwarizmi, introduced the fundamental idea of blancing by subtracting the same term to the other side of the equation. He called this process al-jabr which later became the world algebra.   Exercises - Formulas    Solve each of the following equations for the indicated variable.

  "title": "Absolute Value Equations",
  "body": " Absolute Value Equations   Objective: Solve linear absolute value equations.   When solving equations with absolute value we can end up with more than one possible answer. This is because what is in the absolute value can be either negative or positive and we must account for both possibilities when solving equations. This is illustrated in the following example.     Notice that we have considered two possibilities, both the positive and negative. Either way, the absolute value of our number will be positive .   World View Note: The first set of rules for working with negatives came from 7th century India. However, in , almost a thousand years later, British mathematician Francis Maseres claimed that negatives \"Darken the very whole doctrines of the equations and make dark of the things which are in their nature excessively obvious and simple.\"  When we have absolute values in our problem it is important to first isolate the absolute value, then remove the absolute value by considering both the positive and negative solutions. Notice in the next two examples, all the numbers outside of the absolute value are moved to the other side first before we remove the absolute value bars and consider both positive and negative solutions.        Notice we never combine what is inside the absolute value with what is outside the absolute value. This is very important as it will often change the final result to an incorrect solution. The next example requires two steps to isolate the absolute value. The idea is the same as a two-step equation, add or subtract, then multiply or divide.     Again, we see the same process, get the absolute value alone first, then consider the positive and negative solutions. Often the absolute value will have more than just a variable in it. In this case we will have to solve the resulting equations when we consider the positive and negative possibilities. This is shown in the next example.    Now notice we have two equations to solve, each equation will give us a different solution. Both equations solve like any other two-step equation.    Thus, from our previous example we have two solutions, or .  Again, it is important to remember that the absolute value must be alone first before we consider the positive and negative possibilities. This is illustrated in below.    To get the absolute value alone we first need to get rid of the by subtracting, then divide by . Notice we cannot combine the and, because they are not like terms, the has the absolute value connected to it. Also notice we do not distribute the into the absolute value. This is because the numbers outside cannot be combined with the numbers inside the absolute value. Thus, we get the absolute value alone in the following way:   Now we just solve these two remaining equations to find our solutions.   We now have our two solutions, and .   As we are solving absolute value equations it is important to be aware of special cases. Remember the result of an absolute value must always be positive. Notice what happens in the next example.    Notice the absolute value equals a negative number! This is impossible with absolute value. When this occurs we say there is no solution or .   One other type of absolute value problem is when two absolute values are equal to each other. We still will consider both the positive and negative result, the difference here will be that we will have to distribute a negative into the second absolute value for the negative possibility.    Notice the first equation is the positive possibility and has no significant difference other than the missing absolute value bars. The second equation considers the negative possibility. For this reason, we have a negative in front of the expression which will be distributed through the equation on the first step of solving. So, we solve both these equations as follows:   This gives us our two solutions, or .    Exercises - Absolute Value Equations    Solve each equation.

  "title": "Variation",
  "body": " Variation   Objective: Solve variation problems by creating variation equations and finding the variation constant.   One application of solving linear equations is variation. Often different events are related by what is called the constant of variation. For example, the time it takes to travel a certain distance is related to how fast you are traveling. The faster you travel, the less time it takes to get there. This is one type of variation problem. We will look at three types of variation here. Variation problems have two or three variables and a constant in them. The constant, usually noted with a , describes the relationship and does not change as the other variables in the problem change. There are two ways to set up a variation problem, the first solves for one of the variables, a second method is to solve for the constant. Here we will use the second method.  The Greek letter pi ( ) is used to represent the ratio of the circumference of a circle to its diameter.   World View Note: In the th century, Chinese mathematician Zu Chongzhi calculated the value of to seven decimal places ( ). This was the most accurate value of for the next years!  If you take any circle and divide the circumference of the circle by the diameter you will always get the same value, about . If you have a bigger circumference you will also have a bigger diameter. This relationship is called direct variation or directly proportional . If we see this phrase in the problem, we know to divide to find the constant of variation.     In kickboxing, one will find that the longer the board, the easier it is to break. If you multiply the force required to break a board by the length of the board, you will also get a constant. Here, we are multiplying the variables, which means as one variable increases, the other variable decreases. This relationship is called indirect variation or inversely proportional . If we see this phrase in the problem, we know to multiply to find the constant of variation.     The formula for the area of a triangle has three variables in it. If we divide the area by the base times the height, we will also get a constant, . This relationship is called joint variation or jointly proportional . If we see this phrase in the problem, we know to divide the first variable by the product of the other two to find the constant of variation.     Once we have our formula for the relationship in a variation problem, we use given or known information to calculate the constant of variation. This is shown for each type of variation in the next three examples.              Once we have found the constant of variation, we can use it to find other combinations in the same relationship. Each of these problems we solve will have three important steps, none of which should be skipped.   Find the formula for the relationship using the type of variation  Find the constant of variation using known values  Answer the question using the constant of variation   The next three examples show how this process is worked out for each type of variation.   The price of an item varies directly with the sales tax. If a $ item has a sales tax of $ , what will the tax be on a $ item?     The speed (or rate) Josiah travels to work is inversely proportional to time it takes to get there. If he travels miles per hour it will take him hours to get to work. How long will it take him if he travels miles per hour?     The amount of simple interest earned on an investment varies jointly as the principle (amount invested) and the time it is invested. In an account, $ invested for years earned $ in interest. How much interest would be earned on a $ investment for years?    Sometimes a variation problem will ask us to do something to a variable as we set up the formula for the relationship. For example, can be thought of as the ratio of the area and the radius squared. This is still direct variation; we say the area varies directly as the radius square and thus our variable is squared in our formula. This is shown in the next example.   The area of a circle is directly proportional to the square of the radius. A circle with a radius of has an area of . What will the area be on a circle of radius ?    When solving variation problems, it is important to take the time to clearly state the variation formula, find the constant, and solve the final equation.   Exercises - Variation    Write the formula that expresses the relationship described.     varies directly as      is jointly proportional to and      varies inversely as      varies directly as the square of      varies jointly as and      is inversely proportional to the cube of      is directly proportional to      is jointly proportional with the square of and the square root of      is inversely proportional to       Find the constant of variation and write the formula to express the relationship using that constant.     varies directly as and when      is jointly proportional to and and when and      varies inversely as and when      varies directly as the square of and when      varies jointly as and and when and      is inversely proportional to the cube of and is when      is directly proportional to and when      is jointly proportional with the square of and the square root of and when and      is inversely proportional to and when       Solve each of the following variation problems by setting up a formula to express the relationship, finding the constant, and then answering the question.

  "body": " Application: Number\/Geometry   Objective: Solve number and geometry problems by creating and solving a linear equation.   Word problems can be tricky. Often it takes a bit of practice to convert the English sentence into a mathematical sentence. This is what we will focus on here with some basic number problems, geometry problems, and parts problems.  A few important phrases are described below that can give us clues for how to set up a problem.     A number (or unknown, a value, etc) often becomes our variable     Is (or other forms of is: was, will be, are, etc) often represents equals ( ): \" is \" becomes      More than often represents addition and is usually built backwards, writing the second part plus the first: \"Three more than a number\" becomes      Less than often represents subtraction and is usually built backwards as well, writing the second part minus the first: \"Four less than a number\" becomes     Using these key phrases, we can take a number problem and set up an equation to solve.   If less than five times a certain number is . What is the number?    This same idea can be extended to a more involved problem as shown in the next example.   Fifteen more than three times a number is the same as ten less than six times the number. What is the number?    Another type of number problem involves consecutive numbers. Consecutive numbers are numbers that come one after the other, such as , , . If we are looking for several consecutive numbers, it is important to first identify what they look like with variables before we set up the equation. This is shown in the following example.   The sum of three consecutive integers is . What are the integers?    Sometimes we will work consecutive even or odd integers, rather than just consecutive integers. When we had consecutive integers, we only had to add to get to the next number, so we had , , and for our first, second, and third number respectively. With even or odd numbers, they are spaced apart by two. So if we want three consecutive even numbers, if the first is , the next number would be , then finally add two more to get the third, . The same is true for consecutive odd numbers, if the first is , the next will be , and the third would be . It is important to note that we are still adding and even when the numbers are odd. This is because the phrase “odd” is referring to our , not to what is added to the numbers. Consider the next two examples.   The sum of three consecutive even integers is . What are the integers?     Find three consecutive odd integers so that the sum of twice the first, the second and three times the third is .    When we started with our first, second, and third numbers for both even and odd we had , , and . The numbers added do not change with odd or even, it is our answer for that will be odd or even.  Another example of translating English sentences to mathematical sentences comes from geometry. A well-known property of triangles is that all three angles will always add to . For example, the first angle may be degrees, the second degrees, and the third degrees. If you add these together, . We can use this property to find angles of triangles.   World View Note: German mathematician Bernhart Thibaut in tried to prove that the angles of a triangle add to without using Euclid’s parallel postulate (a point of much debate in math history). He created a proof, but it was later shown to have an error in the proof.   The second angle of a triangle is double the first. The third angle is less than the first. Find the three angles.    Another geometry problem involves perimeter or the distance around an object. For example, consider a rectangle has a length of and a width of . There are two lengths and two widths in a rectangle (opposite sides) so we add . As there are two lengths and two widths in a rectangle an alternative to find the perimeter of a rectangle is to use the formula . So for the rectangle of length and width the formula would give, . With problems that we will consider here the formula will be used.   The perimeter of a rectangle is . The length is less than double the width. Find the dimensions.    We have seen that it is important to start by clearly labeling the variables in a short list before we begin to solve the problem. This is important in all word problems involving variables, not just consecutive numbers or geometry problems. This is shown in the following example.   A sofa and a love seat together costs $ . The sofa costs double the love seat. How much do they each cost?    Be careful on problems such as these. Many students see the phrase “double” and believe that means we only have to divide the by and get $ for one or both of the prices. As you can see this will not work. By clearly labeling the variables in the original list we know exactly how to set up and solve these problems.   Exercises – Number\/Geometry    Evaluate each expression.

  "title": "Points and Lines",
  "body": " Points and Lines   Objective: Graph points and lines using coordinates.   Often, to get an idea of the behavior of an equation, we will make a picture that represents the solutions to the equations. A graph is simply a picture of the solutions to an equation. Before we spend much time on making a visual representation of an equation, we first have to understand the basis of graphing. Following is an example of what is called the coordinate plane.    The plane is divided into four sections by a horizontal number line ( -axis) and a vertical number line ( -axis). Where the two lines meet in the center is called the origin. This center origin is where and . As we move to the right the numbers count up from zero, representing ....   To the left the numbers count down from zero, representing .... Similarly, as we move up, the numbers count up from zero, ...., and as we move down, count down from zero, . We can put dots on the graph which we will call points. Each point has an “address” that defines its location. The first number will be the value on the -axis or horizontal number line. This is the distance the point moves left\/right from the origin. The second number will represent the value on the -axis or vertical number line. This is the distance the point moves up\/down from the origin. The points are given as an ordered pair .   World View Note: Locations on the globe are given in the same manner, each number is a distance from a central point, the origin which is where the prime meridian and the equator. This “origin” is just off the western coast of Africa.  The following example finds the address or coordinate pair for each of several points on the coordinate plane.   Give the coordinates of each point.    Tracing from the origin, point is right , up . This becomes . Point is left , up . Left is backwards or negative, so we have . is straight down units. There is no left or right. This means we go right zero, so the point is .     Just as we can give the coordinates for a set of points, we can take a set of points and plot them on the plane.   Graph the points , , , , , , .       The first point, , is at this means (right ) and (up ). Following these instructions, starting from the origin, we get our point.   The second point, , is left (negative moves backwards), up . This is also illustrated on the graph.          The third point, is right , down (negative moves backwards).   The fourth point, is left , down (both negative, both move backwards).     The last three points have zeros in them. We still treat these points just like the other points. If there is a zero, there is just no movement.       Next is . This is left (negative is backwards), and up zero, right on the -axis.   Then is . This is right zero, and up two, right on the -axis.   Finally is . This point has no movement. Thus, the point is right on the origin.       Our Solution    The main purpose of graphs is not to plot random points, but rather to give a picture of the solutions to an equation. We may have an equation such as . We may be interested in what type of solution are possible in this equation. We can visualize the solution by making a graph of possible and combinations that make this equation a true statement. We will have to start by finding possible and combinations. We will do this using a table of values.    Graph   We make a table of values                                 We will test three values for . Any three can be used.                                    Evaluate each by replacing with the given value:    ;     ;    ;         These then become the points to graph on our equation.        Plot each point.   Once the points are on the graph, connect the dots to make a line.   The graph is our solution.      What this line tells us is that any point on the line will work in the equation . For example, notice the graph also goes through the point . If we use , we should get . Sure enough, , just as the graph suggests. Thus, we have the line is a picture of all the solutions for . We can use this table of values method to draw a graph of any linear equation.                                   We will test three values for . Any three can be used.                                   Our completed table.

  "title": "Slope",
  "body": " Slope   Objective: Find the slope of a line given a graph or two points.   As we graph lines, we will want to be able to identify different properties of the lines we graph. One of the most important properties of a line is its slope. Slope is a measure of steepness. A line with a large slope, such as , is very steep. A line with a small slope, such as , is very flat. We will also use slope to describe the direction of the line. A line that goes up from left to right will have a positive slope and a line that goes down from left to right will have a negative slope.  As we measure steepness, we are interested in how fast the line rises compared to how far the line runs. For this reason, we will describe slope as the fraction . Rise would be a vertical change, or a change in the -values. Run would be a horizontal change, or a change in the -values. So, another way to describe slope would be the fraction . It turns out that if we have a graph, we can draw vertical and horizontal lines from one point to another to make what is called a slope triangle. The sides of the slope triangle give us our slope. The following examples show graphs that we find the slope of using this idea.     To find the slope of this line, we will consider the rise, or vertical change, and the run or, horizontal change. Drawing these lines in makes a slope triangle that we can use to count from one point to the next. The graph goes down , right . This is rise , run . As a fraction it would be . Reduce the fraction to get .      World View Note: When French mathematicians Rene Descartes and Pierre de Fermat first developed the coordinate plane and the idea of graphing lines (and other functions) the -axis was not a vertical line!     To find the slope of this line, the rise is up , and the run is right . Our slope is then written as a fraction, or . This fraction reduces to . This will be our slope.     There are two special lines that have unique slopes that we need to be aware of. They are illustrated in the following example.     In this graph there is no rise, but the run is units. This slope becomes . This line, and all horizontal lines, have a zero slope.     This line has a rise of , but no run. The slope becomes undefined. This line, and all vertical lines, have no slope.    As you can see there is a big difference between having a zero slope and having no slope or undefined slope. Remember, slope is a measure of steepness. The first slope is not steep at all, in fact it is flat. Therefore it has a zero slope. The second slope can’t get any steeper. It is so steep that there is no number large enough to express how steep it is. This is an undefined slope.  We can find the slope of a line through two points without seeing the points on a graph. We can do this using a slope formula. If the rise is the change in values, we can calculate this by subtracting the values of a point. Similarly, if run is a change in the values, we can calculate this by subtracting the values of a point. In this way we get the following equation for slope.   When mathematicians began working with slope, it was called the modular slope. For this reason, we often represent the slope with the variable . Now, we have the following for slope.   As we subtract the values and the values when calculating slope, it is important we subtract them in the same order. This process is shown in the following examples.        We may come up against a problem that has a zero slope (horizontal line) or no slope (vertical line) just as with using the graphs.        Again, there is a big difference between no slope and a zero slope. Zero is an integer and it has a value, the slope of a flat horizontal line. No slope has no value, it is undefined, the slope of a vertical line.  Using the slope formula, we can also find missing points if we know what the slope is. This is shown in the following two examples.   Find the value of between the points and with slope .     Find the value of between the points and with slope .

  "body": " Slope-Intercept Form   Objective: Give the equation of a line with a known slope and y-intercept.   When graphing a line, we found one method we could use is to make a table of values. However, if we can identify some properties of the line, we may be able to make a graph much quicker and easier. One such method is finding the slope and the y-intercept of the equation. The slope can be represented by m and the y-intercept, where it crosses the axis and , can be represented by where b is the value where the graph crosses the vertical y-axis. Any other point on the line can be represented by . Using this information, we will look at the slope formula and solve the formula for .     This equation, can be thought of as the equation of any line that as a slope of m and a y-intercept of . This formula is known as the slope-intercept equation.   Slope - Intercept Equation:   If we know the slope and the y-intercept we can easily find the equation that represents the line.     We can also find the equation by looking at a graph and finding the slope and y-intercept.        Identify the point where the graph crosses the -axis . This means the -intercept is .   Identify one other point and draw a slope triangle to find the slope. The slope is .    Slope-intercept equation.  Our Solution      We can also move the opposite direction, using the equation identify the slope and y-intercept and graph the equation from this information. However, it will be important for the equation to first be in slope intercept form. If it is not, we will have to solve it for so we can identify the slope and the y-intercept.     Once we have an equation in slope-intercept form we can graph it by first plotting the y-intercept, then using the slope, find a second point and connecting the dots.         Starting with a point at the y-intercept of ,   Then use the slope , so we will rise unit and run units to find the next point.   Once we have both points, connect the dots to get our graph.       World View Note: Before our current system of graphing, French Mathematician Nicole Oresme, in suggested graphing lines that would look more like a bar graph with a constant slope!         Starting with a point at the y-intercept of ,   Then use the slope , so we will drop unit and run units to find the next point.   Once we have both points, connect the dots to get our graph.      We want to be very careful not to confuse using slope to find the next point with use a coordinate such as to find an individual point. Coordinates such as start from the origin and move horizontally first, and vertically second. Slope starts from a point on the line that could be anywhere on the graph. The numerator is the vertical change and the denominator is the horizontal change.  Lines with zero slope or no slope can make a problem seem very different. Zero slope, or horizontal line, will simply have a slope of zero which when multiplied by gives zero. So, the equation simply becomes or is equal to the y-coordinate of the graph. If we have no slope, or a vertical line, the equation can’t be written in slope intercept at all because the slope is undefined. There is no y in these equations. We will simply make equal to the -coordinate of the graph.        Give the equation of the line in the graph.   Because we have a vertical line and no slope there is no slope-intercept equation we can use. Rather we make equal to the -coordinate of     Our Solution       Exercises - Slope-Intercept Form    Write the slope-intercept form of the equation of each line given the slope and the y-intercept.                                         Write the slope-intercept form of the equation of each line.

The slope-intercept form has the advantage of being simple to remember and use, however, it has one major disadvantage: we must know the y-intercept in order to use it! Generally, we do not know the y-intercept, we only know one or more points (that are not the y-intercept). In these cases, we can’t use the slope intercept equation, so we will use a different more flexible formula. If we let the slope of an equation be , and a specific point on the line be and any other point on the line be . We can use the slope formula to make a second equation.       If we know the slope, of an equation and any point on the line we can easily plug these values into the equation above which will be called the point slope formula.   Point - Slope Formula:    Write the equation of the line through the point with a slope of .    Often, we will prefer final answers be written in slope intercept form. If the directions ask for the answer in slope-intercept form we will simply distribute the slope, then solve for .   Write the equation of the line through the point with a slope of in slope-intercept form.    An important thing to observe about the point slope formula is that the operation between the ’s and ’s is subtraction. This means when you simplify the signs you will have the opposite of the numbers in the point. We need to be very careful with signs as we use the point-slope formula.  In order to find the equation of a line we will always need to know the slope. If we don’t know the slope to begin with, we will have to do some work to find it first before we can get an equation.   Find the equation of the line through the points and .     Find the equation of the line through the points and in slope intercept form.     Find the equation of the line through the points and in slope intercept form.     World View Note: The city of Konigsberg (now Kaliningrad, Russia) had a river that flowed through the city breaking it into several parts. There were 7 bridges that connected the parts of the city. In 1735 Leonhard Euler considered the question of whether it was possible to cross each bridge exactly once and only once. It turned out that this problem was impossible, but the work laid the foundation of what would become graph theory   Exercises - Point-Slope Form    Write the point-slope form of the equation of the line through the given point with the given slope.    through , slope undefined   through , slope undefined    through , slope    through , slope     through , slope    through , slope     through , slope    through , slope     through , slope    through , slope     through , slope    through , slope    through , slope    through , slope     through , slope    through , slope       Write the slope-intercept form of the equation of the line through the given point with the given slope.    through: , slope    through: , slope     through: , slope    through: , slope     through: , slope    through: , slope     through: , slope    through: , slope     through: , slope    through: , slope     through: , slope    through: , slope     through: , slope undefined   through: , slope     through: , slope    through: , slope       Write the point-slope form of the equation of the line through the given points.    through: and    through: and     through: and    through: and     through: and    through: and     through: and    through: and     through: and    through: and       Write the slope-intercept form of the equation of the line through the given points.    through: and    through: and     through: and    through: and     through: and    through: and     through: and    through: and    through: and    through: and      "

There is an interesting connection between the slope of lines that are parallel and the slope of lines that are perpendicular (meet at a right angle). This is shown in the following example.     The above graph has two parallel lines. The slope of the top line is down , run , or . The slope of the bottom line is down , run as well, or .     The above graph has two perpendicular lines. The slope of the flatter line is up , run or . The slope of the steeper line is down , run or .       World View Note: Greek Mathematician Euclid lived around BC and published a book titled, The Elements . In it is the famous parallel postulate which mathematicians have tried for years to drop from the list of postulates. The attempts have failed, yet all the work done has developed new types of geometries!  As the above graphs illustrate, parallel lines have the same slope and perpendicular lines have opposite (one positive, one negative) reciprocal (flipped fraction) slopes. We can use these properties to make conclusions about parallel and perpendicular lines   Find the slope of a line parallel to .     Find the slope of a line perpendicular to     Once we have a slope, it is possible to find the complete equation of the second line if we know one point on the second line.   Find the equation of a line through and parallel to .     Find the equation of the line through perpendicular to in slope-intercept form.    Zero slopes and no slopes may seem like opposites (one is a horizontal line, one is a vertical line). Because a horizontal line is perpendicular to a vertical line, we can say that no slope and zero slope are actually perpendicular slopes!   Find the equation of the line through perpendicular to     Being aware that to be perpendicular to a vertical line means we have a horizontal line through a value of , thus we could have jumped from this point right to the solution, .   Exercises - Parallel and Perpendicular Lines    Find the slope of a line parallel to each given line.

  "body": " Solve and Graph Inequalities   Objective: Solve, graph, and give interval notation for the solution to linear inequalities.  When we have an equation such as we have a specific value for our variable. With inequalities we will give a range of values for our variable. To do this we will not use equals, but one of the following symbols:    World View Note: English mathematician Thomas Harriot first used the above symbols in . However, they were not immediately accepted as symbols such as and were already coined by another English mathematician, William Oughtred.  If we have an expression such as , this means our variable can be any number smaller than such as or even as long as it is smaller than . If we have an expression such as , this means our variable can be any number greater than or equal to , such as , or even .  Because we don’t have one set value for our variable, it is often useful to draw a picture of the solutions to the inequality on a number line. We will start from the value in the problem and bold the lower part of the number line if the variable is smaller than the number, and bold the upper part of the number line if the variable is larger. The value itself we will mark with brackets, either or for less than or greater than respectively, and or for less than or equal to or greater than or equal to respectively.  Once the graph is drawn we can quickly convert the graph into what is called interval notation. Interval notation gives two numbers, the first is the smallest value, the second is the largest value. If there is no largest value, we can use (infinity). If there is no smallest value, we can use negative infinity. If we use either positive or negative infinity we will always use a curved bracket for that value.  Graph the inequality and give the interval notation.    Our Graph     Graph the inequality and give the interval notation.    Our Graph     We can also take a graph and find the inequality for it.    Give the inequality for the graph:   Graph starts at and goes up or greater. Curved bracket means just greater than     Give the inequality for the graph:   Graph starts at and goes down or less. Square bracket means less than or equal to   Generally when we are graphing and giving interval notation for an inequality we will have to first solve the inequality for our variable. Solving inequalities is very similar to solving equations with one exception. Consider the following inequality and what happens when various operations are done to it. Notice what happens to the inequality sign as we add, subtract, multiply and divide by both positive and negative numbers to keep the statment a true statement.   As the above problem illustrates, we can add, subtract, multiply, or divide on both sides of the inequality. But if we multiply or divide by a negative number, the symbol will need to flip directions. We will keep that in mind as we solve inequalities.  Solve and give interval notation.     The inequality we solve can get as complex as the linear equations we solved. We will use all the same patterns to solve these inequalities as we did for solving equations. Just remember that any time we multiply or divide by a negative the symbol switches directions (multiplying or dividing by a positive does not change the symbol!)  Solve and give interval notation     It is important to be careful when the inequality is written backwards as in the previous example ( rather than ). Often students draw their graphs the wrong way when this is the case. The inequality symbol opens to the variable, this means the variable is greater than . So we must shade above the .

  "title": "Compound Inequalities",
  "body": " Compound Inequalities   Objective: Solve, graph and give interval notation to the solution of compound inequalities.   Several inequalities can be combined together to form what are called compound inequalities. There are three types of compound inequalities which we will investi- gate in this lesson.  The first type of a compound inequality is an OR inequality. For this type of inequality we want a true statment from either one inequality OR the other inequality OR both. When we are graphing these type of inequalities we will graph each individual inequality above the number line, then move them both down together onto the actual number line for our graph that combines them together.  When we give interval notation for our solution, if there are two different parts to the graph we will put a (union) symbol between two sets of interval notation, one for each part.  Solve each inequality, graph the solution, and give interval notation of solution.      World View Note: The symbol for infinity was first used by the Romans, although at the time the number was used for . The greeks also used the symbol for .  There are several different results that could result from an OR statement. The graphs could be pointing different directions, as in the graph above, or pointing in the same direction as in the graph below on the left, or pointing opposite direc- tions, but overlapping as in the graph below on the right. Notice how interval notation works for each of these cases.       As the graphs overlap, we take the largest graph for our solution.  When the graphs are combined they cover the entire number line.    Interval Notation:  Interval Notation: , or   The second type of compound inequality is an AND inequality. AND inequalities require both statements to be true. If one is false, they both are false. When we graph these inequalities we can follow a similar process, first graph both inequali- ties above the number line, but this time only where they overlap will be drawn onto the number line for our final graph. When our solution is given in interval notation it will be expressed in a manner very similar to single inequalities (there is a symbol that can be used for AND, the intersection - , but we will not use it here).  Solve each inequality, graph the solution, and express it interval notation.     Again, as we graph AND inequalities, only the overlapping parts of the individual graphs makes it to the final number line. As we graph AND inequalities there are also three different types of results we could get. The first is shown in the above example. The second is if the arrows both point the same way, this is shown below on the left. The third is if the arrows point opposite ways but don’t overlap, this is shown below on the right. Notice how interval notation is expressed in each case.       In this graph, the overlap is only the smaller graph, so this is what makes it to the final number line.  In this graph there is no overlap of the parts. Because their is no overlap, no values make it to the final number line.    Interval Notation:  Interval Notation: No Solution or   The third type of compound inequality is a special type of AND inequality. When our variable (or expression containing the variable) is between two numbers, we can write it as a single math sentence with three parts, such as , to show is between and (or equal to ). When solving these type of inequalities, because there are three parts to work with, to stay balanced we will do the same thing to all three parts (rather than just both sides) to isolate the variable in the middle. The graph then is simply the values between the numbers with appropriate brackets on the ends.  Solve the inequality, graph the solution, and give interval notation.

  "title": "Absolute Value Inequalities",
  "body": " Absolute Value Inequalities   Objective: Solve, graph and give interval notation for the solution to inequalities with absolute values.   When an inequality has an absolute value we will have to remove the absolute value in order to graph the solution or give interval notation. The way we remove the absolute value depends on the direction of the inequality symbol.  Consider .  Absolute value is defined as distance from zero. Another way to read this inequality would be the distance from zero is less than . So on a number line we will shade all points that are less than units away from zero. This graph looks just like the graphs of the three part compound inequalities! When the absolute value is less than a number we will remove the absolute value by changing the problem to a three part inequality, with the negative value on the left and the positive value on the right. So becomes , as the graph above illustrates.  Consider .  Absolute value is defined as distance from zero. Another way to read this inequality would be the distance from zero is greater than . So on the number line we shade all points that are more than units away from zero. This graph looks just like the graphs of the OR compound inequalities! When the absolute value is greater than a number we will remove the absolute value by changing the problem to an OR inequality, the first inequality looking just like the problem with no absolute value, the second flipping the inequality symbol and changing the value to a negative. So becomes or , as the graph above illustrates.   World View Note: The phrase “absolute value” comes from German mathematician Karl Weierstrass in , though he used the absolute value symbol for complex numbers. The first known use of the symbol for integers comes from a edition of a college algebra text!  For all absolute value inequalities we can also express our answers in interval notation which is done the same way it is done for standard compound inequalities.  We can solve absolute value inequalities much like we solved absolute value equa- tions. Our first step will be to isolate the absolute value. Next we will remove the absolute value by making a three part inequality if the absolute value is less than a number, or making an OR inequality if the absolute value is greater than a number. Then we will solve these inequalites. Remember, if we multiply or divide by a negative the inequality symbol will switch directions!  Solve, graph, and give interval notation for the solution.     Solve, graph, and give interval notation for the solution.     In the previous example, we cannot combine and because they are not like terms, the has an absolute value attached. So we must first clear the by adding , then divide by . The next example is similar.  Solve, graph, and give interval notation for the solution.     In the previous example, we cannot distribute the into the absolute value. We can never distribute or combine things outside the absolute value with what is inside the absolute value. Our only way to solve is to first isolate the absolute value by clearing the values around it, then either make a compound inequality (and OR or a three part) to solve.  It is important to remember as we are solving these equations, the absolute value is always positive. If we end up with an absolute value is less than a negative number, then we will have no solution because absolute value will always be positive, greater than a negative. Similarly, if absolute value is greater than a negative, this will always happen. Here the answer will be all real numbers.  Solve, graph, and give interval notation for the solution.

  "body": " Graphing   Objective: Solve systems of equations by graphing and identifying the point of intersection.   We have solved problems like by adding to both sides and then dividing by (solution is ). We also have methods to solve equations with more than one variable in them. It turns out that to solve for more than one variable we will need the same number of equations as variables. For example, to solve for two variables such as x and y we will need two equations. When we have several equations we are using to solve, we call the equations a system of equations . When solving a system of equations we are looking for a solution that works in both equations. This solution is usually given as an ordered pair . The following example illustrates a solution working in both equations      As we found a true statement for both equations we know is the solution to the system. It is in fact the only combination of numbers that works in both equations. In this lesson we will be working to find this point given the equations. It seems to follow that if we use points to describe the solution, we can use graphs to find the solutions.  If the graph of a line is a picture of all the solutions, we can graph two lines on the same coordinate plane to see the solutions of both equations. We are interested in the point that is a solution for both lines, this would be where the lines intersect! If we can find the intersection of the lines we have found the solution that works in both equations.       To graph each equation, we start at the -intercept and use the slope to get the next point and connect the dots.  Remember a negative slope is downhill!  Find the intersection point,    Our Solution     Often our equations won’t be in slope-intercept form and we will have to solve both equations for first so we can idenfity the slope and -intercept.       To graph each equation, we start at the -intercept and use the slope to get the next point and connect the dots.  Remember a negative slope is downhill!  Find the intersection point,    Our Solution     As we are graphing our lines, it is possible to have one of two unexpected results. These are shown and discussed in the next two example.       To graph each equation, we start at the -intercept and use the slope to get the next point and connect the dots.  The two lines do not intersect! They are parallel! If the lines do not intersect we know that there is no point that works in both equations, there is no solution  No solution     We also could have noticed that both lines had the same slope. Remembering that parallel lines have the same slope we would have known there was no solution even without having to graph the lines.       To graph each equation, we start at the -intercept and use the slope to get the next point and connect the dots.  Both equations are the same line! As one line is directly on top of the other line, we can say that the lines “intersect” at all the points! Here we say we have infinite solutions.     Once we had both equations in slope-intercept form we could have noticed that the equations were the same. At this point we could have stated that there are infinite solutions without having to go through the work of graphing the equations.   World View Note: The Babylonians were the first to work with systems of equations with two variables. However, their work with systems was quickly passed by the Greeks who would solve systems of equations with three or four variables and around AD, developed methods for solving systems with any number of unknowns!

  "title": "Substitution",
  "body": " Substitution   Objective: Solve systems of equations using substitution.   When solving a system by graphing has several limitations. First, it requires the graph to be perfectly drawn, if the lines are not straight we may arrive at the wrong answer. Second, graphing is not a great method to use if the answer is really large, over for example, or if the answer is a decimal the that graph will not help us find, for example. For these reasons we will rarely use graphing to solve our systems. Instead, an algebraic approach will be used.  The first algebraic approach is called substitution. We will build the concepts of substitution through several example, then end with a five-step process to solve problems using this method.     When we know what one variable equals we can plug that value (or expression) in for the variable in the other equation. It is very important that when we substitute, the substituted value goes in parenthesis. The reason for this is shown in the next example.     By using the entire expression to replace in the other equation we were able to reduce the system to a single linear equation which we can easily solve for our first variable. However, the lone variable (a variable without a coefficient) is not always alone on one side of the equation. If this happens we can isolate it by solving for the lone variable.     The process in the previous example is how we will solve problems using substitution. This process is described and illustrated in the following table which lists the five steps to solving by substitution.   Solving Systems of Equations by Substitution    Problem       1. Find the lone variable       2. Solve for the lone variable       3. Substitute into the untouched equation       4. Solve      5. Plug into lone variable equation and evaluate      Solution  (-1,-3)     Sometimes we have several lone variables in a problem. In this case we will have the choice on which lone variable we wish to solve for, either will give the same final result.     Just as with graphing it is possible to have no solution (parallel lines) or infinite solutions (same line) with the substitution method. While we won’t have a parallel line or the same line to look at and conclude if it is one or the other, the process takes an interesting turn as shown in the following example.     Because we had a true statement, and no variables, we know that anything that works in the first equation, will also work in the second equation. However, we do not always end up with a true statement.     Because we had a false statement, and no variables, we know that nothing will work in both equations.   World View Note: French mathematician Rene Descartes wrote a book which included an appendix on geometry. It was in this book that he suggested using letters from the end of the alphabet for unknown values. This is why often we are solving for the variables , , and .  One more question needs to be considered, what if there is no lone variable? If there is no lone variable substitution can still work to solve, we will just have to select one variable to solve for and use fractions as we solve.     Using the fractions does make the problem a bit more tricky. This is why we have another method for solving systems of equations that will be discussed in another lesson.

  "body": " Addition\/Elimination   Objective: Solve systems of equations using the addition\/elimination method.   When solving systems we have found that graphing is very limited when solving equations. We then considered a second method known as substituion. This is probably the most used idea in solving systems in various areas of algebra. How- ever, substitution can get ugly if we don’t have a lone variable. This leads us to our second method for solving systems of equations. This method is known as either Elimination or Addition. We will set up the process in the following examples, then define the five step process we can use to solve by elimination.     In the previous example one variable had opposites in front of it, and . Adding these together eliminated the y completely. This allowed us to solve for the . This is the idea behind the addition method. However, generally we won’t have opposites in front of one of the variables. In this case we will manipulate the equations to get the opposites we want by multiplying one or both equations (on both sides!). This is shown in the next example.     When we looked at the terms, and we decided to multiply the by to get the opposites we were looking for. What we are looking for with our opposites is the least common multiple (LCM) of the coefficients. We also could have solved the above problem by looking at the terms with , and . The LCM of and is . So we would want to multiply both equations, the by , and the by to get opposites, and . This illustrates an important point, some problems we will have to multiply both equations by a constant (on both sides) to get the opposites we want.     It is important for each problem as we get started that all variables and constants are lined up before we start multiplying and adding equations. This is illustrated in the next example which includes the five steps we will go through to solve a problem using elimination.   Solving a System of Equations by Addition\/Elimination    Problem           1. Line up the variables and constants      2. Multiply to get opposites (use LCD)      3. Add      4. Solve      5. Plug into either original and solve      Solution        World View Note: The famous mathematical text, The Nine Chapters on the Mathematical Art , which was printed around AD in China describes a for- mula very similar to Gaussian elimination which is very similar to the addition method.  Just as with graphing and substution, it is possible to have no solution or infinite solutions with elimination. Just as with substitution, if the variables all disappear from our problem, a true statment will indicate infinite solutions and a false stat- ment will indicate no solution.        We have covered three different methods that can be used to solve a system of two equations with two variables. While all three can be used to solve any system, graphing works great for small integer solutions. Substitution works great when we have a lone variable, and addition works great when the other two methods fail. As each method has its own strengths, it is important you are familiar with all three methods.   Exercises - Addition\/Elimination    Solve each system by elimination.

  "body": " Three Variables   Objective: Solve systems of equations with three variables using addi- tion\/elimination.   Solving systems of equations with variables is very similar to how we solve systems with two variables. When we had two variables we reduced the system down to one with only one variable (by substitution or addition). With three variables we will reduce the system down to one with two variables (usually by addition), which we can then solve by either addition or substitution.  To reduce from three variables down to two it is very important to keep the work organized. We will use addition with two equations to eliminate one variable. This new equation we will call (A). Then we will use a different pair of equations and use addition to eliminate the same variable. This second new equation we will call (B). Once we have done this we will have two equations (A) and (B) with the same two variables that we can solve using either method. This is shown in the following examples.     As we are solving for , , and we will have an ordered triplet instead of just the ordered pair . In this above problem, was easily eliminated using the addition method. However, sometimes we may have to do a bit of work to get a variable to eliminate. Just as with addition of two equations, we may have to multiply equations by something on both sides to get the opposites we want so a variable eliminates. As we do this remmeber it is improtant to eliminate the same variable both times using two different pairs of equations.      World View Note: Around , The Nine Chapters on the Mathematical Art were published in China. This book had problems, and chapter was about solving systems of equations. One problem had four equations with five variables!  Just as with two variables and two equations, we can have special cases come up with three variables and three equations. The way we interpret the result is identical.        Equations with three (or more) variables are not any more difficult than two variables if we are careful to keep our information organized and eliminate the same variable twice using two different pairs of equations. It is possible to solve each system several different ways. We can use different pairs of equations or eliminate variables in different orders, but as long as our information is organized and our algebra is correct, we will arrive at the same final solution.

  "title": "Value Problems",
  "body": " Value Problems   Objective: Solve value problems by setting up a system of equations.   One application of system of equations are known as value problems. Value problems are ones where each variable has a value attached to it. For example, if our variable is the number of nickles in a person’s pocket, those nickles would have a value of five cents each. We will use a table to help us set up and solve value problems. The basic structure of the table is shown below.       Number  Value  Total    Item         Item         Total         The first column in the table is used for the number of things we have. Quite often, this will be our variables. The second column is used for the that value each item has. The third column is used for the total value which we calculate by multiplying the number by the value. For example, if we have dimes, each with a value of cents, the total value is cents. The last row of the table is for totals. We only will use the third row (also marked total) for the totals that are given to use. This means sometimes this row may have some blanks in it. Once the table is filled in we can easily make equations by adding each column, setting it equal to the total at the bottom of the column. This is shown in the following example.   In a child’s bank are coins that have a value of . The coins are either quarters or dimes. How many coins each does the child have?       Number  Value  Total    Quarter       Dime       Total       Using value table, use for quarters, for dimes Each quarter’s value is cents, dime’s is cents        Number  Value  Total    Quarter       Dime       Total        Multiply number by value to get totals         Number  Value  Total    Quarter       Dime       Total       We have coins total. This is the number total. We have for the final total. Write final total in cents . Because and are cents      World View Note: American coins are the only coins that do not state the value of the coin. On the back of the dime it says “one dime” (not cents). On the back of the quarter it says “one quarter” (not cents). On the penny it says “one cent” (not cent). The rest of the world (Euros, Yen, Pesos, etc) all write the value as a number so people who don’t speak the language can easily use the coins.  Ticket sales also have a value. Often different types of tickets sell for different prices (values). These problems can be solve in much the same way.   There were tickets sold for an event. Tickets for children cost and tickets for adults cost . Total receipts for the event were . How many of each type of ticket were sold?       Number  Value  Total    Child       Adult       Total       Using our value table, for child, for adult Child tickets have value , adult value is (we can drop the zeros after the decimal point)        Number  Value  Total    Child       Adult       Total        Multiply number by value to get totals         Number  Value  Total    Child       Adult       Total       We have tickets sold. This is our number total The final total was Write in dollars as and are also dollars     Some problems will not give us the total number of items we have. Instead they will give a relationship between the items. Here we will have statements such as “There are twice as many dimes as nickles”. While it is clear that we need to multiply one variable by , it may not be clear which variable gets multiplied by . Generally the equations are backwards from the English sentence. If there are twice as many dimes, than we multiply the other variable (nickels) by two. So the equation would be . This type of problem is in the next example.   A man has a collection of stamps made up of cent stamps and cent stamps. There are three times as many cent stamps as cent stamps. The total value of all the stamps is . How many of each stamp does he have?       Number  Value  Total    Five       Eight       Total       Using our value table, for five cent stamp, and for eight. Also list value of each stamp under value column.        Number  Value  Total    Five       Eight       Total        Multiply number by value to get total         Number  Value  Total    Five       Eight       Total       The final total was (written in cents) We do not know the total number, this is left blank.     The same process for solving value problems can be applied to solving interest problems. Our table titles will be adjusted slightly as we do so.      Invest  Rate  Interest    Account        Account         Total        Our first column is for the amount invested in each account. The second column is the interest rate earned (written as a decimal - move decimal point twice left), and the last column is for the amount of interest earned. Just as before, we multiply the investment amount by the rate to find the final column, the interest earned. This is shown in the following example.   A woman invests in two accounts, one at interest, the other at interest for one year. At the end of the year she had earned in interest. How much did she have invested in each account?       Invest  Rate  Interest    Account       Account       Total       Use our investment table, and for accounts Fill in interest rates as decimals        Invest  Rate  Interest    Account       Account       Total       Multiply across to find interest earned.        Number  Value  Total    Account       Account       Total       Total investment is Total interest was      The same process can be used to find an unknown interest rate.   John invests in one account and in an account paying more in interest. He earned in interest after one year. At what rates did he invest?       Invest  Rate  Interest    Account       Account       Total       Our investment table. Use for first rate. The second rate is higher, or . Be sure to write this rate as a decimal!        Invest  Rate  Interest    Account       Account       Total       Multiply to fill in interest column. Be sure to distribute         Invest  Rate  Interest    Account       Account       Total    1230    Total interest was       Exercises – Value Problems   Solve.

  "title": "Mixture Problems",
  "body": " Mixture Problems   Objective: Solve mixture problems by setting up a system of equations.   One application of systems of equations are mixture problems. Mixture problems are ones where two different solutions are mixed together resulting in a new final solution. We will use the following table to help us solve mixture problems:      Amount  Part  Total    Item         Item         Final        The first column is for the amount of each item we have. The second column is labeled “part”. If we mix percentages we will put the rate (written as a decimal) in this column. If we mix prices we will put prices in this column. Then we can multiply the amount by the part to find the total. Then we can get an equation by adding the amount and\/or total columns that will help us solve the problem and answer the questions.  These problems can have either one or two variables. We will start with one variable problems.   A chemist has mL of a methane solution. How much of a solution must she add so the final solution is methane?       Amount  Part  Total    Start       Add       Final        Set up the mixture table. We start with , but don’t know how much we add, that is . The part is the percentages, for start, for add.         Amount  Part  Total    Start       Add       Final        Add amount column to get final amount. The part for this amount is because we want the final solution to be methane.         Amount  Part  Total    Start       Add       Final        Multiply amount by part to get total.  Be sure to distribute on the last row:      The same process can be used if the starting and final amount have a price attached to them, rather than a percentage.   A coffee mix is to be made that sells for by mixing two types of coffee. The cafe has mL of coffee that costs . How much of another coffee that costs should the cafe mix with the first?       Amount  Part  Total    Start       Add       Final        Set up the mixture table. We know the starting amount and its cost, . The added amount we do not know but we do know its cost is .         Amount  Part  Total    Start       Add       Final        Add the amounts to get the final amount. We want this final amount to sell for .         Amount  Part  Total    Start       Add       Final        Multiply amount by part to get the total.  Be sure to distribute on the last row:       World View Note: Brazil is the world’s largest coffee producer, producing million metric tons of coffee a year! That is over three times as much coffee as second place Vietnam!  The above problems illustrate how we can put the mixture table together and get an equation to solve. However, here we are interested in systems of equations, with two unknown values. The following example is one such problem.   A farmer has two types of milk, one that is butterfat and another which is butterfat. How much of each should he use to end up with gallons of butterfat?       Amount  Part  Total    Milk       Milk       Final        We don't know either start value, but we do know final is .Also fill in part column with percentage of each type of milk including the final solution         Amount  Part  Total    Milk       Milk       Final        Multiply amount by part to get totals.      The same process can be used to solve mixtures of preces with two unknowns.   In a candy shop, chocolate which sells for a pound is mixed with nuts which are sold for a pound are mixed to form a chocolate-nut candy which sells for a pound. How much of each are used to make pounds of the mixture?       Amount  Part  Total    Chocolate       Nut       Final        Using our mixture table, use and for variables. We do know the final amount and price, include this in the table         Amount  Part  Total    Chocolate       Nut       Final        Multiply amount by part to get totals.      With mixture problems we often are mixing with a pure solution or using water which contains none of our chemical we are interested in. For pure solutions, the percentage is (or in the table). For water, the percentage is . This is shown in the following example.   A solution of pure antifreeze is mixed with water to make a $65%$ antifreeze solution. How much of each should be sued to make $70$ L?       Amount  Part  Total    Antifreeze       Water       Final        We use and for our variables. Antifreeze is pure, or in our table, written as a decimal. Water has no antifreeze, its percentage is . We also fill in the final percent         Amount  Part  Total    Antifreeze       Water       Final        Multiply to find final amounts       Exercises – Mixture Problems   Solve.

  "title": "Exponent Properties",
  "body": " Exponent Properties   Objective: Simplify expressions using the properties of exponents.   Problems with exponents can often be simplified using a few basic exponent properties. Exponents represent repeated multiplication. We will use this fact to discover the important properties.   World View Note: The word exponent comes from the Latin “expo” meaning out of and “ponere” meaning place. While there is some debate, it seems that the Babylonians living in Iraq were the first to do work with exponents (dating back to the 23rd century BC or earlier!)     A quicker method to arrive at our answer would have been to just add the exponents: This is known as the product rule of exponents   Product Rule of Exponents: a^ma^ n = a^{m+n}   The product rule of exponents can be used to simplify many problems. We will add the exponent on like variables. This is shown in the following examples.        Rather than multiplying, we will now try to divide with exponents     A quicker method to arrive at the solution would have been to just subtract the exponents, . This is known as the quotient rule of exponents.   Quotient Rule of Exponents: .   The quotient rule of exponents can similarly be used to simplify exponent problems by subtracting exponents on like variables. This is shown in the following examples.            A third property we will look at will have an exponent problem raised to a second exponent. This is investigated in the following example.       A quicker method to arrive at the solution would have been to just multiply the exponents, . This is known as the power of a power rule of exponents.   Power of a Power Rule of Exponents:   This property is often combined with two other properties which we will investigate now.       A quicker method to arrive at the solution would have been to take the exponent of three and put it on each factor in parenthesis, . This is known as the power of a product rule or exponents   Power of a Product Rule of Exponents:    It is important to be careful to only use the power of a product rule with multiplication inside parenthesis. This property does NOT work if there is addition or subtraction.     Another property that is very similar to the power of a product rule is considered next.     A quicker method to arrive at the solution would have been to put the exponent on every factor in both the numerator and denominator, . This is known as the power of a quotient rule of exponents.   Power of a Quotient Rule of Exponents:    The power of a power, product and quotient rules are often used together to simplify expressions. This is shown in the following examples.          As we multiply exponents it’s important to remember these properties apply to exponents, not bases. An expression such as does not mean we multiply by , rather we multiply three times, . This is shown in the next example.     In the previous example we did not put the on the and multiply to get , this would have been incorrect. Never multiply a base by the exponent. These properties pertain to exponents only, not bases.  In this lesson we have discussed different exponent properties. These rules are summarized in the following table.   Rules of Exponents    Product Rule of Exponents     Quotient Rule of Exponents     Power of a Power Rule of Exponents      Power of a Product Rule of Exponents      Power of a Quotient Rule of Exponents      These five properties are often mixed up in the same problem. Often there is a bit of flexibility as to which property is used first. However, order of operations still applies to a problem. For this reason, it is the suggestion of the author to simplify inside any parenthesis first, then simplify any exponents (using power rules), and finally simplify any multiplication or division (using product and quotient rules). This is illustrated in the next few examples.                 Clearly these problems can quickly become quite involved. Remember to follow order of operations as a guide, simplify inside parenthesis first, then power rules, then product and quotient rules.   Exercises - Exponent Properties    Simplify.

  "body": " Negative Exponents   Objective: Simplify expressions with negative exponents using the properties of exponents.   There are a few special exponent properties that deal with exponents that are not positive. The first is considered in the following example, which is worked out different ways:     This final result is an important property known as the zero power rule of exponents:   Any number or expression raised to the zero power will always be . This is illustrated in the following example.     Another property we will consider here deals with negative exponents. Again we will solve the following example two ways.     This example illustrates an important property of exponents. Negative exponents yield the reciprocal of the base. Once we take the reciprocal the exponent is now positive. Also, it is important to note a negative exponent does not mean the expression is negative, only that we need the reciprocal of the base. Following are the rules of negative exponents:     Negative exponents can be combined in several different ways. As a general rule, if we think of our expression as a fraction, negative exponents in the numerator must be moved to the denominator. Likewise, negative exponents in the denominator need to be moved to the numerator. When the base with exponent moves, the exponent is now positive. This is illustrated in the following example.     As we simplified our fraction, we took special care to move the bases that had a negative exponent, but the expression itself did not become negative because of those exponents. Also, it is important to remember that exponents only effect what they are attached to. The in the denominator of the above example does not have an exponent on it, so it does not move with the .  We now have the following nine properties of exponents. It is important that we are very familiar with all of them.     World View Note: Nicolas Chuquet, the French mathematician of the th century, wrote to indicate . This was the first known use of the negative exponent.  Simplifying with negative exponents is much the same as simplifying with positive exponents. It is the advice of the author to keep the negative exponents until the end of the problem and then move them around to their correct location (numerator or denominator). As we do this it is important to be very careful of rules for adding, subtracting, and multiplying with negatives. This is illustrated in the following examples.        In the previous example it is important to point out that when we simplified we moved the three to the denominator and the exponent became positive. We did not make the number negative! Negative exponents never make the bases negative, they simply mean we have to take the reciprocal of the base. One final example with negative exponents is given here.      Exercises - Negative Exponents    Simplify. Your answer should contain only positive expontents.

  "title": "Scientific Notation",
  "body": " Scientific Notation   Objective: Multiply and divide expressions using scientific notation and exponent properties.   One application of exponent properties comes from scientific notation. Scientific notation is used to represent really large or really small numbers. An example of really large numbers would be the distance that light travels in a year in miles. An example of really small numbers would be the mass of a single hydrogen atom in grams. Doing basic operations such as multiplication and division with these numbers would normally be very combersome. However, our exponent properties make this process much simpler.  First we will take a look at what scientific notation is. Scientific notation has two parts, a number between one and ten (it can be equal to one, but not ten), and that number multiplied by ten to some exponent.   The exponent, , is very important to how we convert between scientific notation and normal numbers, or standard notation. The exponent tells us how many times we will multiply by . Multiplying by in affect moves the decimal point one place. So the exponent will tell us how many times the exponent moves between scientific notation and standard notation. To decide which direction to move the decimal (left or right) we simply need to remember that positive exponents mean in standard notation we have a big number (bigger than ten) and negative exponents mean in standard notation we have a small number (less than one).  Keeping this in mind, we can easily make conversions between standard notation and scientific notation.              Converting between standard notation and scientific notation is important to understand how scientific notation works and what it does. Here our main interest is to be able to multiply and divide numbers in scientific notation using exponent properties. The way we do this is first do the operation with the front number (multiply or divide) then use exponent properties to simplify the ’s. Scientific notation is the only time where it will be allowed to have negative exponents in our final solution. The negative exponent simply informs us that we are dealing with small numbers. Consider the following examples.           Often when we multiply or divide in scientific notation the end result is not in sci- entific notation. We will then have to convert the front number into scientific notation and then combine the ’s using the product property of exponents and adding the exponents. This is shown in the following examples.      World View Note: Archimedes ( BC - BC), the Greek mathematician, developed a system for representing large numbers using a system very similar to scientific notation. He used his system to calculate the number of grains of sand it would take to fill the universe. His conclusion was grains of sand because he figured the universe to have a diameter of stadia or about light years.      Exercises - Integers    Write each number in scientific notiation.                                    Write each number in standard notation.                                    Simplify. Write each answer in scientific notation.                                                                                                                                                           "

The term polynomial means many terms. Monomials, binomials, trinomials, and expressions with more terms all fall under the umbrella of “polynomials”.  If we know what the variable in a polynomial represents we can replace the variable with the number and evaluate the polynomial as shown in the following example.     It is important to be careful with negative variables and exponents. Remember the exponent only effects the number it is physically attached to. This means because the exponent is only attached to the . Also, because the exponent is attached to the parenthesis and effects everything inside. When we replace a variable with parenthesis like in the previous example, the substituted value is in parenthesis. So the in the example. However, consider the next example.      World View Note: Ada Lovelace in described a Difference Engine that would be used to caluclate values of polynomials. Her work became the foundation for what would become the modern computer (the programming language Ada was named in her honor), more than years after her death from cancer.  Generally when working with polynomials we do not know the value of the variable, so we will try and simplify instead. The simplest operation with polynomials is addition. When adding polynomials we are mearly combining like terms. Consider the following example.     Generally final answers for polynomials are written so the exponent on the variable counts down. The previous example demonstrates this with the exponent counting down , , , (recall ). Subtracting polynomials is almost as fast. One extra step comes from the minus in front of the parenthesis. When we have a negative in front of parenthesis we distribute it through, changing the signs of everything inside. The same is done for the subtraction sign.     Addition and subtraction can also be combined into the same problem as shown in this final example.

  "title": "Multiplying Polynomial",
  "body": " Multiplying Polynomial   Objective: Multiply polynomials.   Multiplying polynomials can take several different forms based on what we are multiplying. We will first look at multiplying monomials, then monomials by polynomials and finish with polynomials by polynomials.  Multiplying monomials is done by multiplying the numbers or coefficients and then adding the exponents on like factors. This is shown in the next example.     In the previous example it is important to remember that the z has an exponent of when no exponent is written. Thus for our answer the has an exponent of . Be very careful with exponents in polynomials. If we are adding or subtracting the exponnets will stay the same, but when we multiply (or divide) the exponents will be changing.  Next we consider multiplying a monomial by a polynomial. We have seen this operation before with distributing through parenthesis. Here we will see the exact same process.     Following is another example with more variables. When distributing the exponents on are added and the exponents on are added.     There are several different methods for multiplying polynomials. All of which work, often students prefer the method they are first taught. Here three methods will be discussed. All three methods will be used to solve the same two multiplication problems.   Multiply by Distributing  Just as we distribute a monomial through parenthesis we can distribute an entire polynomial. As we do this we take each term of the second polynomial and put it in front of the first polynomial.     This example illustrates an important point, the negative\/subtraction sign stays with the . Which means on the second step the negative is also distributed through the last set of parenthesis.  Multiplying by distributing can easily be extended to problems with more terms. First distribute the front parenthesis onto each term, then distribute again!     This process of multiplying by distributing can easily be reversed to do an important procedure known as factoring. Factoring will be addressed in a future lesson.   Multiply by FOIL  Another form of multiplying is known as FOIL. Using the FOIL method we multiply each term in the first binomial by each term in the second binomial. The letters of FOIL help us remember every combination. F stands for First, we multiply the first term of each binomial. O stand for Outside, we multiply the outside two terms. I stands for Inside, we multiply the inside two terms. L stands for Last, we multiply the last term of each binomial. This is shown in the next example.     Some students like to think of the FOIL method as distributing the first term through the and distributing the second term through the . Thinking about FOIL in this way makes it possible to extend this method to problems with more terms.     The second step of the FOIL method is often not written, for example, consider the previous example, a student will often go from the problem and do the multiplication mentally to come up with and then combine like terms to come up with the final solution.   Multiplying in rows  A third method for multiplying polynomials looks very similar to multiplying numbers. Consider the problem:      World View Note: The first known system that used place values comes from Chinese mathematics, dating back to AD or earlier.  The same process can be done with polynomials. Multiply each term on the bottom with each term on the top.     This same process is easily expanded to a problem with more terms.     This method of multiplying in rows also works with multiplying a monomial by a polynomial!  Any of the three described methods work to multiply polynomials. It is suggested that you are very comfortable with at least one of these methods as you work through the practice problems. All three methods are shown in the next example.      When we are multiplying a monomial by a polynomial by a polynomial we can solve by first multiplying the polynomials then distributing the coefficient last. This is shown in the last example.     A common error students do is distribute the three at the start into both paren- thesis. While we can distribute the into the factor, distributing into both would be wrong. Be careful of this error. This is why it is suggested to multiply the binomials first, then distribute the coeffienct last.

  "body": " Multiply Special Products   Objective: Recognize and use special product rules of a sum and difference and perfect squares to multiply polynomials.   There are a few shortcuts that we can take when multiplying polynomials. If we can recognize them the shortcuts can help us arrive at the solution much quicker. These shortcuts will also be useful to us as our study of algebra continues.  The first shortcut is often called a sum and a difference . A sum and a difference is easily recognized as the numbers and variables are exactly the same, but the sign in the middle is different (one sum, one difference). To illustrate the shortcut consider the following example, multiplied by the distributing method.     The important part of this example is the middle terms subtracted to zero. Rather than going through all this work, when we have a sum and a difference we will jump right to our solution by squaring the first term and squaring the last term, putting a subtraction between them. This is illustrated in the following example.     This is much quicker than going through the work of multiplying and combining like terms. Often students ask if they can just multiply out using another method and not learn the shortcut. These shortcuts are going to be very useful when we get to factoring polynomials, or reversing the multiplication process. For this reason it is very important to be able to recognize these shortcuts. More examples are shown here.        It is interesting to note that while we can multiply and get an answer like (with subtraction), it is impossible to multiply real numbers and end up with a product such as (with addition).  Another shortcut used to multiply is known as a perfect square . These are easy to recognize as we will have a binomial with a in the exponent. The following example illustrates multiplying a perfect square     This problem also helps us find our shortcut for multiplying. The first term in the answer is the square of the first term in the problem. The middle term is times the first term times the second term. The last term is the square of the last term. This can be shortened to square the first, twice the product, square the last. If we can remember this shortcut we can square any binomial. This is illustrated in the following example.     Be very careful when we are squaring a binomial to NOT distribute the square through the parenthesis. A common error is to do the following: (or ). Notice both of these are missing the middle term, . This is why it is important to use the shortcut to help us find the correct solution. Another important observation is that the middle term in the solution always has the same sign as the middle term in the problem. This is illustrated in the next examples.           These two formulas will be important to commit to memory. The more familiar we are with them, the easier factoring, or multiplying in reverse, will be. The final example covers both types of problems (two perfect squares, one positive, one negative), be sure to notice the difference between the examples and how each formula is used.             World View Note: There are also formulas for higher powers of binomials as well, such as . While French mathematician Blaise Pascal often gets credit for working with these expansions of binomials in the th century, Chinese mathematicians had been working with them almost years earlier!

  "body": " Divide Polynomials   Objective: Divide polynomials using long division.   Dividing polynomials is a process very similar to long division of whole numbers. But before we look at that, we will first want to be able to master dividing a polynomial by a monomial. The way we do this is very similar to distributing, but the operation we distribute is the division, dividing each term by the monomial and reducing the resulting expression. This is shown in the following examples        The previous example illustrates that sometimes we will have fractions in our solution, as long as they are reduced this will be correct for our solution. Also interesting in this problem is the second term divided out completely. Remember that this means the reduced answer is not .  Long division is required when we divide by more than just a monomial. Long division with polynomials works very similar to long division with whole numbers.  An example is given to review the (general) steps that are used with whole numbers that we will also use with polynomials.     This same process will be used to multiply polynomials. The only difference is we will replace the word “number” with the word “term”.   Dividing Polynomials   Divide front terms  Multiply this term by the divisor  Change the sign of the terms and combine  Bring down the next term  Repeat    Step number 3 tends to be the one that students skip, not changing the signs of the terms would be equivalent to adding instead of subtracting on long division with whole numbers. Be sure not to miss this step! This process is illustrated in the following two examples.        In both of the previous example the dividends had the exponents on our variable counting down, no exponent skipped, third power, second power, first power, zero power (remember so there is no variable on zero power). This is very important in long division, the variables must count down and no exponent can be skipped. If they don’t count down we must put them in order. If an exponent is skipped we will have to add a term to the problem, with zero for its coefficient. This is demonstrated in the following example.     It is important to take a moment to check each problem to verify that the exponents count down and no exponent is skipped. If so we will have to adjust the problem. Also, this final example illustrates, just as in regular long division, sometimes we have no remainder in a problem.   World View Note: Paolo Ruffini was an Italian Mathematician of the early th century. In he was the first to describe a process called synthetic division which could also be used to divide polynomials.

  "title": "Greatest Common Factor",
  "body": " Greatest Common Factor   Objective: Find the greatest common factor of a polynomial and factor it out of the expression.   The opposite of multiplying polynomials together is factoring polynomials. There are many benifits of a polynomial being factored. We use factored polynomials to help us solve equations, learn behaviors of graphs, work with fractions and more. Because so many concepts in algebra depend on us being able to factor polynomials it is very important to have very strong factoring skills.  In this lesson we will focus on factoring using the greatest common factor or GCF of a polynomial. When we multiplied polynomials, we multiplied monomials by polynomials by distributing, solving problems such as . In this lesson we will work the same problem backwards. We will start with and try and work backwards to the .  To do this we have to be able to first identify what is the GCF of a polynomial. We will first introduce this by looking at finding the GCF of several numbers. To find a GCF of sevearal numbers we are looking for the largest number that can be divided by each of the numbers. This can often be done with quick mental math and it is shown in the following example.  Find the GCF of , , and .   When there are variables in our problem we can first find the GCF of the numbers using mental math, then we take any variables that are in common with each term, using the lowest exponent. This is shown in the next example.  Find the GCF of , , and .   To factor out a GCF from a polynomial we first need to identify the GCF of all the terms, this is the part that goes in front of the parenthesis, then we divide each term by the GCF, the answer is what is left inside the parenthesis. This is shown in the following examples.     With factoring we can always check our solutions by multiplying (distributing in this case) out the answer and the solution should be the original equation.         World View Note: The first recorded algorithm for finding the greatest common factor comes from Greek mathematician Euclid around the year BC!     It is important to note in the previous example, that when the GCF was and was one of the terms, dividing gave an answer of . Students often try to factor out the and get zero which is incorrect, factoring will never make terms dissapear. Anything divided by itself is , be sure to not forget to put the 1 into the solution.  Often the second line is not shown in the work of factoring the GCF. We can simply identify the GCF and put it in front of the parenthesis as shown in the following two examples.        Again, in the previous problem, when dividing by itself, the answer is , not zero. Be very careful that each term is accounted for in your final solution.

  "body": " Grouping   Objective: Factor polynomials with four terms using grouping.   The first thing we will always do when factoring is try to factor out a GCF. This GCF is often a monomial like in the problem the GCF is the monomial , so we would have . However, a GCF does not have to be a monomial, it could be a binomial. To see this, consider the following two example.     Now the same problem, but instead of we have .     In the same way we factored out a GCF of we can factor out a GCF which is a binomial, . This process can be extended to factor problems where there is no GCF to factor out, or after the GCF is factored out, there is more factoring that can be done. Here we will have to use another strategy to factor. We will use a process known as grouping. Grouping is how we will factor if there are four terms in the problem. Remember, factoring is like multiplying in reverse, so first we will look at a multiplication problem and then try to reverse the process.     The solution has four terms in it. We arrived at the solution by looking at the two parts, and . When we are factoring by grouping we will always divide the problem into two parts, the first two terms and the last two terms. Then we can factor the GCF out of both the left and right sides. When we do this our hope is what is left in the parenthesis will match on both the left and right. If they match we can pull this matching GCF out front, putting the rest in parenthesis and we will be factored. The next example is the same problem worked backwards, factoring instead of multiplying.     The key for grouping to work is after the GCF is factored out of the left and right, the two binomials must match exactly. If there is any difference between the two we either have to do some adjusting or it can’t be factored using the grouping method. Consider the following example.    When the signs don’t match on both terms we can easily make them match by fac- toring the opposite of the GCF on the right side. Instead of we will use . This will change the signs inside the second parenthesis.    Often we can recognize early that we need to use the opposite of the GCF when factoring. If the first term of the first binomial is positive in the problem, we will also want the first term of the second binomial to be positive. If it is negative then we will use the opposite of the GCF to be sure they match.     Sometimes when factoring the GCF out of the left or right side there is no GCF to factor out. In this case we will use either the GCF of or . Often this is all we need to be sure the two binomials match.        Another problem that may come up with grouping is after factoring out the GCF on the left and right, the binomials don’t match, more than just the signs are different. In this case we may have to adjust the problem slightly. One way to do this is to change the order of the terms and try again. To do this we will move the second term to the end of the problem and see if that helps us use grouping.     When rearranging terms the problem can still be out of order. Sometimes after factoring out the GCF the terms are backwards. There are two ways that this can happen, one with addition, one with subtraction. If it happens with addition, for example the binomials are and , we don’t have to do any extra work. This is because addition is the same in either order .     However, if the binomial has subtraction, then we need to be a bit more careful. For example, if the binomials are and , we will factor out the opposite of the GCF on one part, usually the second. Notice what happens when we factor out .     Generally we won’t show all the above steps, we will simply factor out the opposite of the GCF and switch the order of the subtraction to make it match the other binomial.

  "body": " Trinomials where    Objective: Factor trinomials where the coefficient of is one.   Factoring with three terms, or trinomials, is the most important type of factoring to be able to master. As factoring is multiplication backwards we will start with a multipication problem and look at how we can reverse the process.     You may notice that if you reverse the last three steps the process looks like grouping. This is because it is grouping! The GCF of the left two terms is and the GCF of the second two terms is . The way we will factor trinomials is to make them into a polynomial with four terms and then factor by grouping. This is shown in the following example, the same problem worked backwards.     The trick to make these problems work is how we split the middle term. Why did we pick and not ? The reason is because is the only combination that works! So how do we know what is the one combination that works? To find the correct way to split the middle term we will use what is called the ac method. In the next lesson we will discuss why it is called the ac method. The way the ac method works is we find a pair of numers that multiply to a cer- tain number and add to another number. Here we will try to multiply to get the last term and add to get the coefficient of the middle term. In the previous example that would mean we wanted to multiply to and add to . The only numbers that can do this are and : and . This process is shown in the next few examples.           Often when factoring we have two variables. These problems solve just like prob- lems with one variable, using the coefficients to decide how to split the middle term.     As the past few examples illustrate, it is very important to be aware of negatives as we find the pair of numbers we will use to split the middle term. Consier the following example, done incorrectly, ignoring negative signs.     Because we did not use the negative sign with the six to find our pair of numbers, the binomials did not match and grouping was not able to work at the end. Now the problem will be done correctly.     You may have noticed a shortcut for factoring these problems. Once we identify the two numbers that are used to split the middle term, these are the two num- bers in our factors! In the previous example, the numbers used to split the middle term were and , our factors turned out to be . This pattern does not always work, so be careful getting in the habit of using it. We can use it however, when we have no number (technically we have a ) in front of . In all the problems we have factored in this lesson there is no number in front of . If this is the case then we can use this shortcut. This is shown in the next few examples.        It is possible to have a problem that does not factor. If there is no combination of numbers that multiplies and adds to the correct numbers, then we say we cannot factor the polynomial, or we say the polynomial is prime. This is shown in the following example.     When factoring it is important not to forget about the GCF. If all the terms in a problem have a common factor we will want to first factor out the GCF before we factor using any other method.     Again it is important to comment on the shortcut of jumping right to the factors, this only works if there is no coefficient on . In the next lesson we will look at how this process changes slightly when we have a number in front of . Be careful not to use this shortcut on all factoring problems!

He used vowels to represent variables we are solving for, just as codes used letters to represent an unknown message.

  "body": " Trinomials where    Objective: Factor trinomials using the ac method when the coefficient of is not one.   When factoring trinomials we used the ac method to split the middle term and then factor by grouping. The ac method gets it’s name from the general trinomial equation, , where , , and are the numbers in front of , and the constant at the end respectively.   World View Note: It was French philosopher Rene Descartes who first used letters from the beginning of the alphabet to represent values we know and letters from the end to represent letters we don’t know and are solving for .  The ac method is named ac because we multiply to find out what we want to multiply to. In the previous lesson we always multiplied to just because there was no number in front of . This meant the number was and we were multiplying to or just . Now we will have a number in front of so we will be looking for numbers that multiply to and add to . Other than this, the process will be the same.     When , or no coefficient in front of , we were able to use a shortcut, using the numbers that split the middle term in the factors. The previous example illustrates an important point, the shortcut does not work when . We must go through all the steps of grouping in order to factor the problem.        The same process works with two variables in the problem.     As always, when factoring we will first look for a GCF before using any other method, including the ac method. Factoring out the GCF first also has the added bonus of making the numbers smaller so the ac method becomes easier.     As was the case with trinomials when , not all trinomials can be factored. If there is no combinations that multiply and add correctly then we can say the trinomial is prime and cannot be factored.      Exercises -Trinomials where     Factor each completely.

  "body": " Factoring Special Products   Objective: Identify and factor special products including a difference of squares, perfect squares, and sum and difference of cubes.   When factoring there are a few special products that, if we can recognize them, can help us factor polynomials. The first is one we have seen before. When multiplying special products we found that a sum and a difference could multiply to a difference of squares. Here we will use this special product to help us factor.     If we are subtracting two perfect squares then it will always factor to the sum and difference of the square roots.        It is important to note, that a sum of squares will never factor. It is always prime. This can be seen if we try to use the ac method to factor .     It turns out that a sum of squares is always prime.     A great example where we see a sum of squares comes from factoring a difference of th powers. Because the square root of a fourth power is a square , we can factor a difference of fourth powers just like we factor a difference of squares, to a sum and difference of the square roots. This will give us two factors, one which will be a prime sum of squares, and a second which will be a difference of squares which we can factor again. This is shown in the following examples.        Another factoring shortcut is the perfect square. We had a shortcut for multi- plying a perfect square which can be reversed to help us factor a perfect square.     A perfect square can be difficult to recognize at first glance, but if we use the ac method and get two of the same numbers we know we have a perfect square. Then we can just factor using the square roots of the first and last terms and the sign from the middle. This is shown in the following examples.         World View Note: The first known record of work with polynomials comes from the Chinese around BC. Problems would be written as “three sheafs of a good crop, two sheafs of a mediocre crop, and one sheaf of a bad crop sold for dou. This would be the polynomial (trinomial) .  Another factoring shortcut has cubes. With cubes we can either do a sum or a difference of cubes. Both sum and difference of cubes have very similar factoring formulas  Comparing the formulas you may notice that the only difference is the signs in between the terms. One way to keep these two formulas straight is to think of SOAP. S stands for Same sign as the problem. If we have a sum of cubes, we add first, a difference of cubes we subtract first. O stands for Opposite sign. If we have a sum, then subtraction is the second sign, a difference would have addition for the second sign. Finally, AP stands for Always Positive. Both formulas end with addition. The following examples show factoring with cubes.        The previous example illustrates an important point. When we fill in the trino- mial’s first and last terms we square the cube roots and . Often students forget to square the number in addition to the variable. Notice that when done correctly, both get cubed.  Often after factoring a sum or difference of cubes, students want to factor the second factor, the trinomial further. As a general rule, this factor will always be prime (unless there is a GCF which should have been factored out before using cubes rule).  The following table sumarizes all of the shortcuts that we can use to factor special products.      As always, when factoring special products it is important to check for a GCF first. Only after checking for a GCF should we be using the special products. This is shown in the following examples.

With so many different tools used to factor, it is easy to get lost as to which tool to use when. Here we will attempt to organize all the different factoring types we have seen. A large part of deciding how to solve a problem is based on how many terms are in the problem. For all problem types we will always try to factor out the GCF first.     2 terms: sum or difference of squares or cubes:    3 terms: ac method, watch for perfect square!    4 terms: grouping   We will use the above strategy to factor each of the following examples. Here the emphasis will be on which strategy to use rather than the steps used in that method.

  "body": " Solve by Factoring   Objective: Solve quadratic equation by factoring and using the zero product rule.   When solving linear equations such as we can solve for the variable directly by adding and dividing by to get . However, when we have (or a higher power of ) we cannot just isolate the variable as we did with the linear equations. One method that we can use to solve for the varaible is known as the zero product rule   The zero product rule tells us that if two factors are multiplied together and the answer is zero, then one of the factors must be zero. We can use this to help us solve factored polynomials as in the following example.     For the zero product rule to work we must have factors to set equal to zero. This means if the problem is not already factored we will factor it first.     Another important part of the zero product rule is that before we factor, the equation must equal zero. If it does not, we must move terms around so it does equal zero. Generally we like the term to be positive.           Most problems with will have two unique solutions. However, it is possible to have only one solution as the next example illustrates.     As always it will be important to factor out the GCF first if we have one. This GCF is also a factor and must also be set equal to zero using the zero product rule. This may give us more than just two solution. The next few examples illustrate this.           In the previous example, the GCF did not have a variable in it. When we set this factor equal to zero we got a false statement. No solution come from this factor. Often a student will skip setting the GCF factor equal to zero if there is no variables in the GCF.  Just as not all polynomials cannot factor, all equations cannot be solved by factoring. If an equation does not factor we will have to solve it using another method. These other methods are saved for another section.   World View Note: While factoring works great to solve problems with , Tartaglia, in th century Italy, developed a method to solve problems with . He kept his method a secret until another mathematician, Cardan, talked him out of his secret and published the results. To this day the formula is known as Cardan’s Formula.  A question often asked is if it is possible to get rid of the square on the variable by taking the square root of both sides. While it is possible, there are a few properties of square roots that we have not covered yet and thus it is common to break a rule of roots that we are not aware of at this point. The short reason we want to avoid this for now is because taking a square root will only give us one of the two answers. When we talk about roots we will come back to problems like these and see how we can solve using square roots in a method called completing the square. For now, never take the square root of both sides !

  "title": "Reduce Rational Expressions",
  "body": " Reduce Rational Expressions   Objective: Reduce rational expressions by dividing out common factors.   Rational expressions are expressions written as a quotient of polynomials. Examples of rational expressions include:   As rational expressions are a special type of fraction, it is important to remember with fractions we cannot have zero in the denominator of a fraction. For this reason, rational expressions may have one more excluded values, or values that the variable cannot be or the expression would be undefined.  State the excluded value(s): This means we can use any value for in the equation except for and . We can however, evaluate any other value in the expression.   World View Note: The number zero was not widely accepted in mathematical thought around the world for many years. It was the Mayans of Central America who first used zero to aid in the use of their base system as a place holder!  Rational expressions are easily evaluated by simply substituting the value for the variable and using order of operations.  Determine the value of the following expression for :   Just as we reduced the previous example, often a rational expression can be reduced, even without knowing the value of the variable. When we reduce we divide out common factors. We have already seen this with monomials when we discussed properties of exponents. If the problem only has monomials we can reduce the coefficients, and subtract exponents on the variables.     However, if there is more than just one term in either the numerator or denominator, we can’t divide out common factors unless we first factor the numerator and denominator.           It is important to remember we cannot reduce terms, only factors. This means if there are any or between the parts we want to reduce we cannot. In the previous example we had the solution , we cannot divide out the ’s because they are terms (separated by or ) not factors (separated by multiplication).

Multiplying and dividing rational expressions is very similar to the process we use to multiply and divide fractions.     The process is identical for division with the extra first step of multiplying by the reciprocal. When multiplying with rational expressions we follow the same process, first divide out common factors, then multiply straight across.     Division is identical in process with the extra first step of multiplying by the reciprocal.     Just as with reducing rational expressions, before we reduce a multiplication problem, it must be factored first.     Again we follow the same pattern with division with the extra first step of multiplying by the reciprocal.     We can combine multiplying and dividing of fractions into one problem as shown below. To solve we still need to factor, and we use the reciprocal of the divided fraction.

  "title": "Least Common Denominators",
  "body": " Least Common Denominators   Objective: Idenfity the least common denominator and build up denominators to match this common denominator.   As with fractions, the least common denominator or LCD is very important to working with rational expressions. The process we use to find the LCD is based on the process used to find the LCD of intergers.     When finding the LCD of several monomials we first find the LCD of the coefficients, then use all variables and attach the highest exponent on each variable.  Find the LCD of and .   The same pattern can be used on polynomials that have more than one term. However, we must first factor each polynomial so we can identify all the factors to be used (attaching highest exponent if necessary).  Find the LCD of and .   Notice we only used once in our LCD. This is because it only appears as a factor once in either polynomial. The only time we need to repeat a factor or use an exponent on a factor is if there are exponents when one of the polynomials is factored.  Find the LCD of and .   The previous example could have also been done with factoring the first polynomial to . Then we would have used twice in the LCD because it showed up twice in one of the polynomials. However, it is the author’s suggestion to use the exponents in factored form so as to use the same pattern (highest exponent) as used with monomials.  Once we know the LCD, our goal will be to build up fractions so they have matching denominators. In this lesson we will not be adding and subtracting frac- tions, just building them up to a common denominator. We can build up a fraction’s denominator by multipliplying the numerator and denoinator by any factors that are not already in the denominator.        As the above example illustrates, we will multiply out our numerators, but keep our denominators factored. The reason for this is to add and subtract fractions we will want to be able to combine like terms in the numerator, then when we reduce at the end we will want our denominators factored.  Once we know how to find the LCD and how to build up fractions to a desired denominator we can combine them together by finding a common denominator and building up those fractions.  Build up each fraction so they have a common denominator.   Build up each fraction so they have a common denominator.    World View Note: When the Egyptians began working with fractions, they expressed all fractions as a sum of unit fraction. Rather than , they would write the fraction as the sum, . An interesting problem with this system is that this is not a unique solution, is also equal to the sum .

  "title": "Add and Subtract",
  "body": " Add and Subtract   Objective: Add and subtract rational expressions with and without common denominators.   Adding and subtracting rational expressions is identical to adding and subtracting with integers. Recall that when adding with a common denominator we add the numerators and keep the denominator. This is the same process used with rational expressions. Remember to reduce, if possible, your final answer.     Subtraction with common denominator follows the same pattern, though the subtraction can cause problems if we are not careful with it. To avoid sign errors we will first distribute the subtraction through the numerator. Then we can treat I like an addition problem. This process is the same as “add the opposite” we saw when subtracting with negatives.      World View Note: The Rhind papyrus of Egypt from BC gives some of the earliest known symbols for addition and subtraction, a pair of legs walking in the direction one reads for addition, and a pair of legs walking in the opposite direction for subtraction.  When we don’t have a common denominator, we will have to find the least common denominator (LCD) and build up each fraction so the denominators match. The following example shows this process with integers.     The same process is used with variables.     The same process can be used for subtraction, we will simply add the first step of adding the opposite.     If our denominators have more than one term in them, we will need to factor first to find the LCD. Then we build up each denominator using the factors that are missing on each fraction.     With subtraction remember to add the opposite.      Exercises – Add and Subtract   Add or subtract the rational expressions. Simplify your answers whenever possible.

  "body": " Complex Fractions   Objective: Simplify complex fractions by multiplying each term by the least common denominator.   Complex fractions have fractions in either the numerator, or denominator, or usually both. These fractions can be simplified in one of two ways. This will be illustrated first with integers, then we will consider how the process can be expanded to include expressions with variables.  The first method uses order of operations to simplify the numerator and denominator first, then divide the two resulting fractions by multiplying by the reciprocal.     The process above works just fine to simplify, but between getting common denominators, taking reciprocals, and reducing, it can be a very involved process. Generally, we prefer a different method to multiply the numerator and denominator of the large fraction (in effect each term in the complex fraction) by the least common denominator (LCD). This will allow us to reduce and clear the small fractions. We will simplify the same problem using this second method.     Clearly the second method is a much cleaner and faster method to arrive at our solution. It is the method we will use when simplifying with variables as well. We will first find the LCD of the small fractions, and multiply each term by this LCD so we can clear the small fractions and simplify.     The process is the same if the LCD is a binomial, we will need to distribute     The more fractions we have in our problem, the more we repeat the same process.      World View Note: Sophie Germain is one of the most famous women in mathematics, many primes, which are important to finding an LCD, carry her name. Germain primes are prime numbers where one more than double the prime number is also prime, for example is prime and so is prime. The largest known Germain prime (at the time of printing) is which has digits!  Some problems may require us to FOIL as we simplify. To avoid sign errors, if there is a binomial in the numerator, we will first distribute the negative through the numerator.     If there are negative exponents in an expression we will have to first convert these negative exponents into fractions. Remember, the exponent is only on the factor it is attached to, not the whole term.     Once we convert each negative exponent into a fraction, the problem solves exactly like the other complex fraction problems.

  "title": "Proportions",
  "body": " Proportions   Objective: Solve proportions using the cross product and use proportions to solve application problems.   When two fractions are equal, they are called a proportion. This definition can be generalized to two equal rational expressions. Proportions have an important property called the cross-product.   The cross product tells us we can multiply diagonally to get an equation with no fractions that we can solve.      World View Note: The first clear definition of a proportion and the notation for a proportion came from the German Leibniz who wrote, “I write ; for is to as is to , is indeed the same as, divided by is equal to divided by . From this equation follow then all the rules of proportion.”  If the proportion has more than one term in either numerator or denominator, we will have to distribute while calculating the cross product.     This same idea can be seen when the variable appears in several parts of the proportion.        As we solve proportions, we may end up with a quadratic that we will have to solve. We can solve this quadratic in the same way we solved quadratics in the past, either factoring, completing the square or the quadratic formula. As with solving quadratics before, we will generally end up with two solutions.     Proportions are very useful in how they can be used in many different types of applications. We can use them to compare different quantities and make conclusions about how quantities are related. As we set up these problems it is important to remember to stay organized, if we are comparing dogs and cats, and the number of dogs is in the numerator of the first fraction, then the numerator of the second fraction should also refer to the dogs. This consistency of the numerator and denominator is essential in setting up our proportions.   A six-foot-tall man casts a shadow that is feet long. If the shadow of a flag pole is feet long, how tall is the flagpole?     In a basketball game, the home team was down by points at the end of the game. They only scored points for every points the visiting team scored. What was the final score of the game?     Exercises - Proportions    Solve each proportion.

When we solved problems like the next example, we cleared the fraction by multiplying by the least common denominator (LCD)     We will use the same process to solve rational equations, the only difference is our LCD will be more involved. We will also have to be aware of domain issues. If our LCD equals zero, the solution is undefined. We will always check our solutions in the LCD as we may have to remove a solution from our solution set.     The LCD can be several factors in these problems. As the LCD gets more complex, it is important to remember the process we are using to solve is still the same.     In the precious example the denominators were factored for us. More often we will need to factor before finding the LCD.      World View Note: Maria Agnesi was the first woman to publish a math textbook in , it took her over years to write! This textbook covered everything from arithmetic through differential equations and was over pages!  If we are subtracting a fraction in the problem, it may be easier to avoid a future sign error by first distributing the negative through the numerator.       In the previous example, one of the solutions we found made the LCD zero. When this happens we ignore this result and only use the results that make the rational expressions defined.

  "title": "Dimensional Analysis",
  "body": " Dimensional Analysis   Objective: Use dimensional analysis to preform single unit, dual unit, square unit, and cubed unit conversions.   One application of rational expressions deals with converting units. When we convert units of measure we can do so by multiplying several fractions together in a process known as dimensional analysis. The trick will be to decide what fractions to multiply. When multiplying, if we multiply by , the value of the expression does not change. One written as a fraction can look like many different things as long as the numerator and denominator are identical in value. Notice the numerator and denominator are not identical in appearance, but rather identical in value. Below are several fractions, each equal to one where numerator and denominator are identical in value.   The last few fractions that include units are called conversion factors. We can make a conversion factor out of any two measurements that represent the same distance. For example, mile feet. We could then make a conversion factor because both values are the same, the fraction is still equal to one. 5280 ft Similarly we could make a conversion factor . The trick for conversions will be to use the correct fractions.  The idea behind dimensional analysis is we will multiply by a fraction in such a way that the units we don’t want will divide out of the problem. We found out when multiplying rational expressions that if a variable appears in the numerator and denominator, we can divide it out of the expression. It is the same with units. Consider the following conversion.     In the previous example, we had to use the conversion factor so the miles would divide out. If we had used we would not have been able to divide out the miles. This is why when doing dimensional analysis, it is very important to use units in the set-up of the problem, so we know how to correctly set up the conversion factor   If pound ounces, how many pounds is ounces?    The same process can be used to convert problems with several units in them. Consider the following example.   A student averaged miles per hour on a trip. What was the student’s speed in feet per second?    If the units are two-dimensional (such as square inches - ) or three-dimensional (such as cubic feet - ) we will need to put the same exponent on the conversion factor. So, if we are converting square inches to square ft , the conversion factor would be squared, . Similarly, if the units are cubed, we will cube the conversion factor.   Convert cubic feet to . Write as a fraction, put it over    When calculating area or volume, be sure to use the units and multiply them as well.   A room is How many square yards are in the room?    To focus on the process of conversions, a conversion sheet has been included at the end of this lesson which includes several conversion factors for length, volume, mass and time in both English and Metric units.  The process of dimensional analysis can be used to convert other types of units as well. If we can identify relationships that represent the same value, we can make them into a conversion factor.   A child is prescribed a dosage of mg of a certain drug and is allowed to refill his prescription twice. If a there are tablets in a prescription, and each tablet has mg, how many doses are in the prescriptions (original refills)?

  "body": " Square Roots   Objective: Simplify expressions with square roots.   Square roots are the most common type of radical used. A square root “unsquares” a number. For example, because we say the square root of is . The square root of is written as .   World View Note: The radical sign, when first used was an R with a line through the tail, similar to our perscription symbol today. The R came from the latin, “radix”, which can be translated as “source” or “foundation”. It wasn’t until the 1500s that our current symbol was first used in Germany (but even then it was just a check mark with no bar over the numbers!  The following table gives several examples of square roots:             Undefined    The final example, is currently undefined as negatives have no square root. This is because if we square a positive or a negative, the answer will be positive. Thus we can only take square roots of positive numbers. In another lesson we will define a method we can use to work with and evaluate negative square roots, but for now we will simply say they are undefined. Not all numbers have a nice even square root. For example, if we found on our calculator, the answer would be and even this number is a rounded approximation of the square root. To be as accurate as possible, we will never use the calculator to find decimal approximations of square roots. Instead we will express roots in simplest radical form. We will do this using a property known as the product rule of radicals   We can use the product rule to simplify an expression such as by splitting it into two roots, \\sqrt{36} * \\sqrt{5}, and simplifying the first root, . The trick in this process is being able to translate a problem like into . There are several ways this can be done. The most common and, with a bit of practice, the fastest method, is to find perfect squares that divide evenly into the radicand, or number under the radical. This is shown in the next example.     If there is a coefficient in front of the radical to begin with, the problem merely becomes a big multiplication problem.     As we simplify radicals using this method it is important to be sure our final answer can be simplified no more.     The previous example could have been done in fewer steps if we had noticed that , but often the time it takes to discover the larger perfect square is more than it would take to simplify in several steps. Variables often are part of the radicand as well. When taking the square roots of variables, we can divide the exponent by . For example, , because we divide the exponent of by . This follows from the power of a power rule of exponents, . When squaring, we multiply the exponent by two, so when taking a square root we divide the exponent by . This is shown in the following example.     We can’t always evenly divide the exponent on a variable by . Sometimes we have a remainder. If there is a remainder, this means the remainder is left inside the radical, and the whole number part is how many are outside the radical. This is shown in the following example.

  "body": " Higher Roots   Objective: Simplify radicals with an index greater than two.   While square roots are the most common type of radical we work with, we can take higher roots of numbers as well: cube roots, fourth roots, fifth roots, etc. Following is a definition of radicals. The small letter inside the radical is called the index. It tells us which root we are taking, or which power we are \"un-doing\". For square roots the index is . As this is the most common root, the two is not usually written.   World View Note: The word for root comes from the French mathematician Franciscus Vieta in the late 16th century.  The following table includes several higher roots.             Undefined    We must be careful of a few things as we work with higher roots. First its important not to forget to check the index on the root. but This is because and Another thing to watch out for is negatives under roots. We can take an odd root of a negative number, because a negative number raised to an odd power is still negative. However, we cannot take an even root of a negative number, this we will say is undefined. In a later section we will discuss how to work with roots of negative, but for now we will simply say they are undefined.  We can simplify higher roots in much the same way we simplified square roots, using the product property of radicals.   Often we are not as familiar with higher powers as we are with squares. It is important to remember what index we are working with as we try and work our way to the solution.     Just as with square roots, if we have a coefficient, we multiply the new coefficients together.     We can also take higher roots of variables. As we do, we will divide the exponent on the variable by the index. Any whole answer is how many of that variable will come out of the square root. Any remainder is how many are left behind inside the square root. This is shown in the following examples.   In the above calculations, for the , we divided , so came out, no ’s remain inside. For the , we divided , so came out, and remains inside. For the , when we divided , all three or remained inside.  The following example includes integers in our problem.

Consider the following example.     Notice that when we combined the terms with it was just like combining terms with . When adding and subtracting with radicals we can combine like radicals just as like terms. We add and subtract the coefficients in front of the radical, and the radical stays the same. This is shown in the following example.     We cannot simplify this expression any more as the radicals do not match. Often problems we solve have no like radicals, however, if we simplify the radicals first we may find we do in fact have like radicals.      World View Note: The Arab writers of the 16th century used the symbol similar to the greater than symbol with a dot underneath for radicals. This exact process can be used to add and subtract radicals with higher indices      Exercises - Adding Radicals    Simplify.

  "body": " Multiply and Divide Radicals   Objective: Multiply and divide radicals using the product and quotient rules of radicals.   Multiplying radicals is very simple if the index on all the radicals match. The product rule of radicals which we have already been using can be generalized as follows:   Another way of stating this rule is we are allowed to multiply the factors outside the radical and we are allowed to multiply the factors inside the radicals, as long as the index matches. This is shown in the following example.     The same process works with higher roots     When multiplying with radicals we can still use the distributive property or FOIL just as we could with variables.         World View Note: Clay tablets have been discovered revealing much about Babylonian mathematics dating back from to BC. In one of the tables there is an approximation of accurate to five decimal places ( )     As we are multiplying we always look at our final solution to check if all the radicals are simplified and all like radicals or like terms have been combined. Division with radicals is very similar to multiplication, if we think about division as reducing fractions, we can reduce the coefficients outside the radicals and reduce the values inside the radicals to get our final solution.      There is one catch to dividing with radicals, it is considered bad practice to have a radical in the denominator of our final answer. If there is a radical in the denominator we will rationalize it, or clear out any radicals in the denominator. We do this by multiplying the numerator and denominator by the same thing. The problems we will consider here will all have a monomial in the denominator. The way we clear a monomial radical in the denominator is to focus on the index. The index tells us how many of each factor we will need to clear the radical. For example, if the index is , we will need of each factor to clear the radical. This is shown in the following examples.           The previous example could have been solved by multiplying numerator and denominator by . However, this would have made the numbers very large and we would have needed to reduce our solution at the end. This is why rewriting the radical as and multiplying by just was the better way to simplify.  We will also always want to reduce our fractions (inside and out of the radical) before we rationalize.     The same process can be used to rationalize fractions with variables.

  "body": " Rationalize Denominators   Objective: Rationalize the denominators of radical expressions.   It is considered bad practice to have a radical in the denominator of a fraction. When this happens we multiply the numerator and denominator by the same thing in order to clear the radical. In the lesson on dividing radicals we talked about how this was done with monomials. Here we will look at how this is done with binomials.  If the binomial is in the numerator the process to rationalize the denominator is essentially the same as with monomials. The only difference is we will have to distribute in the numerator.     It is important to remember that when reducing the fraction we cannot reduce with just the 3 and 12 or just the 9 and 12. When we have addition or subtraction in the numerator or denominator we must divide all terms by the same number.  The problem can often be made easier if we first simplify any radicals in the problem.     As we are rationalizing it will always be important to constantly check our problem to see if it can be simplified more. We ask ourselves, can the fraction be reduced? Can the radicals be simplified? These steps may happen several times on our way to the solution.  If the binomial occurs in the denominator we will have to use a different strategy to clear the radical. Consider , if we were to multiply the denominator by we would have to distribute it and we would end up with . We have not cleared the radical, only moved it to another part of the denominator. So our current method will not work. Instead we will use what is called a conjugate. A conjugate is made up of the same terms, with the opposite sign in the middle. So for our example with in the denominator, the conjugate would be . The advantage of a conjugate is when we multiply them together we have , which is a sum and a difference. We know when we multiply these we get a difference of squares. Squaring and , with subtraction in the middle gives the product . Our answer when multiplying conjugates will no longer have a square root. This is exactly what we want.     In the previous example, we could have reduced by dividing by , giving the solution , both answers are correct.        The same process can be used when there is a binomial in the numerator and denominator. We just need to remember to FOIL out the numerator.        The same process is used when we have variables.      World View Note: During the 5th century BC in India, Aryabhata published a treatise on astronomy. His work included a method for finding the square root of numbers that have many digits.

  "title": "Rational Exponents",
  "body": " Rational Exponents   Objective: Convert between radical notation and exponential notation and simplify expressions with rational exponents using the properties of exponents.   When we simplify radicals with exponents, we divide the exponent by the index. Another way to write division is with a fraction bar. This idea is how we will define rational exponents.   The denominator of a rational exponent becomes the index on our radical, likewise the index on the radical becomes the denominator of the exponent. We can use this property to change any radical expression into an exponential expression.        Index is denominator      Negative exponents from reciprocals    We can also change any rational exponent into a radical expression by using the denominator as the index.        Index is denominator      Negative exponents means reciprocals     World View Note: Nicole Oresme, a Mathematician born in Normandy was the first to use rational exponents. He used the notation to represent . However his notation went largely unnoticed.  The ability to change between exponential expressions and radical expressions allows us to evaluate problems we had no means of evaluating before by changing to a radical.     The largest advantage of being able to change a radical expression into an exponential expression is we are now allowed to use all our exponent properties to simplify. The following table reviews all of our exponent properties.    When adding and subtracting with fractions we need to be sure to have a common denominator. When multiplying we only need to multiply the numerators together and denominators together. The following examples show several different problems, using different properties to simplify the rational exponents.              It is important to remember that as we simplify with rational exponents we are using the exact same properties we used when simplifying integer exponents. The only difference is we need to follow our rules for fractions as well. It may be worth reviewing your notes on exponent properties to be sure your comfortable with using the properties.   Exercises – Rational Exponents    Write each expression in radical form.                     Write each expression in exponential form.              Evaluate.              Simplify. Your answer should contain only positive exponents.                                                        "

  "title": "Radicals of Mixed Index",
  "body": " Radicals of Mixed Index   Objective: Reduce the index on a radical and multiply or divide radicals of different index.  Knowing that a radical has the same properties as exponents (written as a ratio) allows us to manipulate radicals in new ways. One thing we are allowed to do is reduce, not just the radicand, but the index as well. This is shown in the following example.     What we have done is reduced our index by dividing the index and all the exponents by the same number ( in the previous example). If we notice a common factor in the index and all the exponnets on every factor we can reduce by dividing by that common factor. This is shown in the next example.     We can use the same process when there are coefficients in the problem. We will first write the coefficient as an exponential expression so we can divide the exponet by the common factor as well.     We can use a very similar idea to also multiply radicals where the index does not match. First we will consider an example using rational exponents, then identify the pattern we can use.     To combine the radicals we need a common index (just like the common denominator). We will get a common index by multiplying each index and exponent by an integer that will allow us to build up to that desired index. This process is shown in the next example.     Often after combining radicals of mixed index we will need to simplify the resulting radical.     Just as with reducing the index, we will rewrite coefficients as exponential expressions. This will aslo allow us to use exponent properties to simplify.     If there is a binomial in the radical then we need to keep that binomial together through the entire problem.      World View Note: Originally the radical was just a check mark with the rest of the radical expression in parenthesis. In Rene Descartes was the first to put a line over the entire radical expression  The same process is used for dividing mixed index as with multiplying mixed index. The only difference is our final answer cannot have a radical over the denominator.

  "body": " Complex Numbers   Objective: Add, subtract, multiply, rationalize, and simplify expres- sions using complex numbers.    World View Note: When mathematics was first used, the primary purpose was for counting. Thus they did not originally use negatives, zero, fractions or irrational numbers. However, the ancient Egyptians quickly developed the need for \"a part\" and so they made up a new type of number, the ratio or fraction. The Ancient Greeks did not believe in irrational numbers (people were killed for believing otherwise). The Mayans of Central America later made up the number zero when they found use for it as a placeholder. Ancient Chinese Mathematicians made up negative numbers when they found use for them.  In mathematics, when the current number system does not provide the tools to solve the problems the culture is working with, we tend to make up new ways for dealing with the problem that can solve the problem. Throughout history this has been the case with the need for a number that is nothing ( ), smaller than zero (negatives), between integers (fractions), and between fractions (irrational numbers). This is also the case for the square roots of negative numbers. To work with the square root of negative numbers mathematicians have defined what are called imaginary and complex numbers   Examples of imaginary numbers include , , and . A complex number is one that contains both a real and imaginary part, such as .  With this definition, the square root of a negative number is no longer undefined. We now are allowed to do basic operations with the square root of negatives. First we will consider exponents on imaginary numbers. We will do this by manipulating our definition of . If we multiply both sides of the definition by , the equation becomes . Then if we multiply both sides of the equation again by , the equation becomes , or simply . Multiplying again by gives . One more time gives . And if this pattern continues we see a cycle forming, the exponents on i change we cycle through simplified answers of , , , . As there are different possible answers in this cycle, if we divide the exponent by and consider the remainder, we can simplify any exponent on by learning just the following four values:   Cyclic Property of Powers of                    When performing operations (add, subtract, multilpy, divide) we can handle i just like we handle any other variable. This means when adding and subtracting complex numbers we simply add or combine like terms.     It is important to notice what operation we are doing. Students often see the parenthesis and think that means FOIL. We only use FOIL to multiply. This problem is an addition problem so we simply add the terms, or combine like terms.  For subtraction problems the idea is the same, we need to remember to first distribute the negative onto all the terms in the parentheses.     Addition and subtraction can be combined into one problem.     Multiplying with complex numbers is the same as multiplying with variables with one exception, we will want to simplify our final answer so there are no exponents on .              Remember when squaring a binomial we either have to FOIL or use our shortcut to square the first, twice the product and square the last. The next example uses the shortcut.     Dividing with complex numbers also has one thing we need to be careful of. If is , and it is in the denominator of a fraction, then we have a radical in the denominator! This means we will want to rationalize our denominator so there are no ’s. This is done the same way we rationalized denominators with square roots.     The solution for these problems can be written several different ways, for example or . The author has elected to use the solution as written, but it is important to express your answer in the form your instructor prefers.     Using we can simplify radicals with negatives under the root. We will use the product rule and simplify the negative as a factor of negative one. This is shown in the following examples.        When simplifying complex radicals it is important that we take the out of the radical (as an ) before we combine radicals.     If there are fractions, we need to make sure to reduce each term by the same number. This is shown in the following example.     By using we will be able to simplify and solve problems that we could not simplify and solve before. This will be explored in more detail in a later section.

  "body": " Solving with Radicals   Objective: Solve equations with radicals and check for extraneous solutions.   Here we look at equations that have roots in the problem. As you might expect, to clear a root we can raise both sides to an exponent. So to clear a square root we can rise both sides to the second power. To clear a cubed root we can raise both sides to a third power. There is one catch to solving a problem with roots in it, sometimes we end up with solutions that do not actually work in the equation. This will only happen if the index on the root is even, and it will not happen all the time. So for these problems it will be required that we check our answer in the original problem. If a value does not work it is called an extraneous solution and not included in the final solution.          In this example one can also notice at the very beginning that in the left hand side is always nonnegative, no mater what the value of is, hence it will never be equal to the righ hand side .  If the radical is not alone on one side of the equation we will have to solve for the radical before we raise it to an exponent     The above example illustrates that as we solve we could end up with an term or a quadratic. In this case we remember to set the equation to zero and solve by factoring. We will have to check both solutions if the index in the problem was even. Sometimes both values work, sometimes only one, and sometimes neither works   World View Note: The babylonians were the first known culture to solve quadratics in radicals - as early as BC!  If there is more than one square root in a problem we will clear the roots one at a time. This means we must first isolate one of them before we square both sides.     When there is more than one square root in the problem, after isolating one root and squaring both sides we may still have a root remaining in the problem. In this case we will again isolate the term with the second root and square both sides. When isolating, we will isolate the term with the square root. This means the square root can be multiplied by a number after isolating.

As you might expect we can clear exponents by using roots. This is done with very few unex- pected results when the exponent is odd. We solve these problems very straight forward using the odd root property      However, when the exponent is even we will have two results from taking an even root of both sides. One will be positive and one will be negative. This is because both and . So when solving we will have two solutions, one positive and one negative: and .       World View Note: In , French Mathematicain Gerolamo Cardano published his book The Great Art, or the Rules of Algebra which included the solution of an equation with a fourth power, but it was considered absurd by many to take a quantity to the fourth power because there are only three dimensions!     In the previous example we needed two equations to simplify because when we took the root, our solutions were two rational numbers, and . If the roots did not simplify to rational numbers we can keep the in the equation.     When solving with exponents, it is important to first isolate the part with the exponent before taking any roots.        When our exponents are a fraction we will need to first convert the fractional exponent into a radical expression to solve. Recall that . Once we have done this we can clear the exponent using either the even or odd root property. Then we can clear the radical by raising both sides to an exponent (remember to check answers if the index is even).        With rational exponents it is very helpful to convert to radical form to be able to see if we need a because we used the even root property, or to see if we need to check our answer because there was an even root in the problem. When checking we will usually want to check in the radical form as it will be easier to evaluate.

  "body": " Complete the Square   Objective: Solve quadratic equations by completing the square.   When solving quadratic equations in the past we have used factoring to solve for our variable. This is exactly what is done in the next example.     However, the problem with factoring is all equations cannot be factored. Consider the following equation: . The equation cannot be factored, however there are two solutions to this equation, and . To find these two solutions we will use a method known as completing the square. When completing the square we will change the quadratic into a perfect square which can easily be solved with the square root property. The next example reviews the square root property.     To complete the square, or make our problem into the form of the previous example, we will be searching for the third term in a trinomial. If a quadratic is of the form , and a perfect square, the third term, , can be easily found by the formula . This is shown in the following examples, where we find the number that completes the square and then factor the perfect square.           The process in the previous examples, combined with the even root property, is used to solve quadratic equations by completing the square. The following five steps describe the process used to complete the square, along with an example to demonstrate each step.     Problem      Separate constant term from variables       Divide each term by a    Find value to complete the square:     Add to both sides of equation     Factor     Solve by even root property       World View Note: The Chinese in BC were the first known culture group to use a method similar to completing the square, but their method was only used to calculate positive roots.  The advantage of this method is it can be used to solve any quadratic equation. The following examples show how completing the square can give us rational solu- tions, irrational solutions, and even complex solutions.           As several of the examples have shown, when solving by completing the square we will often need to use fractions and be comfortable finding common denominators and adding fractions together. Once we get comfortable solving by completing the square and using the five steps, any quadratic equation can be easily solved.   Exercises - Complete the Square    Find the value that completes the square and then rewrite as a perfect square.                                              Solve each equation by completing the square.

  "body": " Quadratic Formula   Objective: Solve quadratic equations by using the quadratic formula.   The general from of a quadratic is . We will now solve this formula for by completing the square.     This solution is a very important one to us. As we solved a general equation by completing the square, we can use this formula to solve any quadratic equation. Once we identify what a, b, and c are in the quadratic, we can substitute those values into and we will get our two solutions. This formula is known as the quadratic fromula.    World View Note: Indian mathematician Brahmagupta gave the first explicit formula for solving quadratics in . However, at that time mathematics was not done with variables and symbols, so the formula he gave was, \"To the absolute number multiplied by four times the square, add the square of the middle term; the square root of the same, less the middle term, being divided by twice the square is the value.\" This would translate to as the solution to the equation   We can use the quadratic formula to solve any quadratic, this is shown in the following examples.     As we are solving using the quadratic formula, it is important to remember the equation must fist be equal to zero.        When we use the quadratic formula we don’t necessarily get two unique answers. We can end up with only one solution if the square root simplifies to zero.     If a term is missing from the quadratic, we can still solve with the quadratic formula, we simply use zero for that term. The order is important, so if the term with is missing, we have , if the constant term is missing, we have .     We have covered three different methods to use to solve a quadratic: factoring, complete the square, and the quadratic formula. It is important to be familiar with all three as each has its advantage to solving quadratics. The following table walks through a suggested process to decide which method would be best to use for solving a problem.     If it can easily factor, solve by factoring       If and is even, complete the square    Otherwise, solve by the quadratic formula      The above table is mearly a suggestion for deciding how to solve a quadtratic. Remember completing the square and quadratic formula will always work to solve any quadratic. Factoring only woks if the equation can be factored.

  "body": " Build Quadratics From Roots   Objective: Find a quadratic equation that has given roots using reverse factoring and reverse completing the square.   Up to this point we have found the solutions to quadratics by a method such as factoring or completing the square. Here we will take our solutions and work backwards to find what quadratic goes with the solutions.  We will start with rational solutions. If we have rational solutions we can use factoring in reverse, we will set each solution equal to x and then make the equation equal to zero by adding or subtracting. Once we have done this our expressions will become the factors of the quadratic.     If one or both of the solutions are fractions we will clear the fractions by multiplying by the denominators.     If the solutions have radicals (or complex numbers) then we cannot use reverse factoring. In these cases we will use reverse completing the square. When there are radicals the solutions will always come in pairs, one with a plus, one with a minus, that can be combined into “one” solution using . We will then set this solution equal to and square both sides. This will clear the radical from our problem.     We may have to isolate the term with the square root (with plus or minus) by adding or subtracting. With these problems, remember to square a binomial we use the formula       World View Note: Before the quadratic formula, before completing the square, before factoring, quadratics were solved geometrically by the Greeks as early as BC! In Omar Khayyam, a Persian mathematician solved cubic equations geometrically!  If the solution is a fraction we will clear it just as before by multiplying by the denominator.     The process used for complex solutions is identical to the process used for radicals.

  "body": " Quadratic in Form   Objective: Solve equations that are quadratic in form by substitution to create a quadratic equation.   We have seen three different ways to solve quadratics: factoring, completing the square, and the quadratic formula. A quadratic is any equation of the form , however, we can use the skills learned to solve quadratics to solve problems with higher (or sometimes lower) powers if the equation is in what is called quadratic form.   Quadratic Form: where    An equation is in quadratic form if one of the exponents on a variable is double the exponent on the same variable somewhere else in the equation. If this is the case we can create a new variable, set it equal to the variable with smallest exponent. When we substitute this into the equation we will have a quadratic equation we can solve.   World View Note: Arab mathematicians around the year were the first to use this method!     When we have higher powers of our variable, we could end up with many more solutions. The previous equation had four unique solutions.     Just as with regular quadratics, these problems will not always have rational solutions. We also can have irrational or complex solutions to our equations.     When we create a new variable for our substitution, it won’t always be equal to just another variable. We can make our substitution variable equal to an expression as shown in the next example.        The higher the exponent, the more solution we could have. This is illustrated in the following example, one with six solutions.      Exercises – Quadratic in Form    Solve each of the following equations. Some equations will have complex roots.

  "body": " Quadratics - Rectangles   Objective:Solve applications of quadratic equations using rectangles.   An application of solving quadratic equations comes from the formula for the area of a rectangle. The area of a rectangle can be calculated by multiplying the width by the length. To solve problems with rectangles we will first draw a picture to represent the problem and use the picture to set up our equation.     The above rectangle problem is very simple as there is only one rectangle involved. When we compare two rectangles, we may have to get a bit more creative.   If each side of a square is increased by , the area is multiplied by . Find the side of the original square.     The length of a rectangle is ft greater than the width. If each dimension is increased by , the new area will be square feet larger. Find the dimensions of the original rectangle.    From one rectangle we can find two equations. Perimeter is found by adding all the sides of a polygon together. A rectangle has two widths and two lengths, both the same size. So we can use the equation (twice the length plus twice the width).   The area of a rectangle is . The perimeter of the same rectangle is . What are the dimensions of the rectangle?     World View Note: Indian mathematical records from the 9th century demonstrate that their civilization had worked extensively in geometry creating religious alters of various shapes including rectangles.  Another type of rectangle problem is what we will call a “frame problem”. The idea behind a frame problem is that a rectangle, such as a photograph, is centered inside another rectangle, such as a frame. In these cases, it will be important to remember that the frame extends on all sides of the rectangle. This is shown in the following example.   An in by in picture has a frame of uniform width around it. The area of the frame is equal to the area of the picture. What is the width of the frame?     A farmer has a field that is rods by rods. He is mowing the field in a spiral pattern, starting from the outside and working in towards the center. After an hour of work, of the field is left uncut. What is the size of the ring cut around the outside?    For each of the frame problems above we could have also completed the square or use the quadratic formula to solve the trinomials. Remember that completing the square or the quadratic formula always will work when solving, however, factoring only works if we can factor the trinomial.   Exercises - Rectangles   In a landscape plan, a rectangular flowerbed is designed to be meters longer than it is wide. If square meters are needed for the plants in the bed, what should the dimensions of the rectangular bed be?    If the side of a square is increased by the area is multiplied by . Find the side of the original square.    A rectangular lot is yards longer than it is wide and its area is square yards. Find the dimensions of the lot.

  "body": " Quadratics - Teamwork   Objective: Solve teamwork problems by creating a rational equation to model the problem.   If it takes one person hours to paint a room and another person hours to paint the same room, working together they could paint the room even quicker, it turns out they would paint the room in hours together. This can be reasoned by the following logic, if the first person paints the room in hours, she paints of the room each hour. If the second person takes hours to paint the room, he paints of the room each hour. So together, each hour they paint of the room. Using a common denominator of gives: . This means each hour, working together they complete of the room. If is completed each hour, it follows that it will take hours to complete the entire room.  This pattern is used to solve teamwork problems. If the first person does a job in , a second person does a job in , and together they can do a job in (total). We can use the teamwork equation.   Often these problems will involve fractions. Rather than thinking of the first fraction as , it may be better to think of it as the reciprocal of ’s time.   World View Note: When the Egyptians, who were the first to work with fractions, wrote fractions, they were all unit fractions (numerator of one). They only used these type of fractions for about years! Some believe that this cumbersome style of using fractions was used for so long out of tradition, others believe the Egyptians had a way of thinking about and working with fractions that has been completely lost in history.   Adam can clean a room in hours. If his sister Maria helps, they can clean it in hours. How long will it take Maria to do the job alone?    Sometimes we only know how two people’s times are related to each other as in the next example.   Mike takes twice as long as Rachel to complete a project. Together they can complete the project in hours. How long will it take each of them to complete the project alone?    With problems such as these we will often end up with a quadratic to solve.   Brittney can build a large shed in days less than Cosmo can. If they built it together it would take them days. How long would it take each of them working alone?    In the previous example, when solving, one of the possible times ended up negative. We can’t have a negative amount of time to build a shed, so this possibility is ignored for this problem. Also, as we were solving, we had to factor . This may have been difficult to factor. We could have also chosen to complete the square or use the quadratic formula to find our solutions.  It is important that units match as we solve problems. This means we may have to convert minutes into hours to match the other units given in the problem.   An electrician can complete a job in one hour less than his apprentice. Together they do the job in hour and minutes. How long would it take each of them working alone?    Very similar to a teamwork problem is when the two involved parts are working against each other. A common example of this is a sink that is filled by a pipe and emptied by a drain. If they are working against each other we need to make one of the values negative to show they oppose each other. This is shown in the next example.   A sink can be filled by a pipe in minutes but it takes minutes to drain a full sink. If both the pipe and the drain are open, how long will it take to fill the sink?     Exercises - Teamwork   Bills father can paint a room in two hours less than Bill can paint it. Working together they can complete the job in two hours and minutes. How much time would each require working alone?    Of two inlet pipes, the smaller pipe takes four hours longer than the larger pipe to fill a pool. When both pipes are open, the pool is filled in three hours and forty-five minutes. If only the larger pipe is open, how many hours are required to fill the pool?    Jack can wash and wax the family car in one hour less than Bob can. The two working together can complete the job in hours. How much time would each require if they worked alone?    If A can do a piece of work alone in days and B can do it alone in days, how long will it take the two working together to complete the job?    Working alone it takes John hours longer than Carlos to do a job. Working together they can do the job in hours. How long will it take each to do the job working alone?    A can do a piece of work in days, B in days, and C in days each working alone. How long will it take them to do it working together?    A can do a piece of work in days and B can do it in half the time. How long will it take them to do the work together?    A cistern can be filled by one pipe in minutes and by another in minutes. How long will it take both pipes together to fill the tank?    If A can do a piece of work in days and A and B together can do it in days, how long would it take B to do the work alone?    A carpenter and his assistant can do a piece of work in days. If the carpenter himself could do the work alone in days, how long would the assistant take to do the work alone?    If Sam can do a certain job in days, while it takes Fred days to do the same job, how long will it take them, working together, to complete the job?    Tim can finish a certain job in hours. It take his wife JoAnn only hours to do the same job. If they work together, how long will it take them to complete the job?    Two people working together can complete a job in hours. If one of them works twice as fast as the other, how long would it take the faster person, working alone, to do the job?    If two people working together can do a job in hours, how long will it take the slower person to do the same job if one of them is times as fast as the other?    A water tank can be filled by an inlet pipe in hours. It takes twice that long for the outlet pipe to empty the tank. How long will it take to fill the tank if both pipes are open?    A sink can be filled from the faucet in minutes. It takes only minutes to empty the sink when the drain is open. If the sink is full and both the faucet and the drain are open, how long will it take to empty the sink?    It takes hours to fill a pool with the inlet pipe. It can be emptied in hrs with the outlet pipe. If the pool is half full to begin with, how long will it take to fill it from there if both pipes are open?    A sink is full when both the faucet and the drain are opened. The faucet alone can fill the sink in minutes, while it takes minutes to empty it with the drain. How long will it take to fill the remaining of the sink?    A sink has two faucets, one for hot water and one for cold water. The sink can be filled by a cold-water faucet in minutes. If both faucets are open, the sink is filled in minutes. How long does it take to fill the sink with just the hot-water faucet open?    A water tank is being filled by two inlet pipes. Pipe A can fill the tank in hrs, while both pipes together can fill the tank in hours. How long does it take to fill the tank using only pipe B?    A tank can be emptied by any one of three caps. The first can empty the tank in minutes while the second takes minutes. If all three working together could empty the tank in minutes, how long would the third take to empty the tank?    One pipe can fill a cistern in hours while a second pipe can fill it in hrs. Three pipes working together fill the cistern in minutes. How long would it take the third pipe alone to fill the tank?    Sam takes hours longer than Susan to wax a floor. Working together they can wax the floor in hours. How long will it take each of them working alone to wax the floor?    It takes Robert hours longer than Paul to repair a transmission. If it takes them hours to do the job if they work together, how long will it take each of them working alone?    It takes Sally minutes longer than Patricia to clean up their dorm room. If they work together they can clean it in minutes. How long will it take each of them if they work alone?    A takes minutes longer than B to do a job. Working together they can do the job in minutes. How long does it take each working alone?    Secretary A takes minutes longer than Secretary B to type pages of manuscript. If they divide the job and work together it will take them minutes to type pages. How long will it take each working alone to type the pages?    It takes John minutes longer than Sally to mow the lawn. If they work together they can mow the lawn in minutes. How long will it take each to mow the lawn if they work alone?    "

  "body": " Quadratics - Graphs of Quadratics   Objective: Graph quadratic equations using the vertex, x-intercepts, and y-intercept.   Just as we drew pictures of the solutions for lines or linear equations, we can draw a picture of solution to quadratics as well. One way we can do that is to make a table of values.       Plot the points , , , , and .  Connect the dots with a smooth curve.  Our Solution     When we have in our equations, the graph will no longer be a straight line. Quadratics have a graph that looks like a U shape that is called a parabola.   World View Note: The first major female mathematician was Hypatia of Egypt who was born around 370 AD. She studied conic sections. The parabola is one type of conic section.  The above method to graph a parabola works for any equation, however, it can be very tedious to find all the correct points to get the correct bend and shape. For this reason we identify several key points on a graph and in the equation to help us graph parabolas more efficiently. These key points are described below.     Point  -intercept: Where the graph crosses the vertical -axis.  Points and  -intercepts: Where the graph crosses the horizontal -axis  Point Vertex: The point where the graph curves and changes directions.    We will use the following method to find each of the points on our parabola.  To graph the equation , find the following points    -intercept: Found by making , this simplifies down to   -intercepts: Found by making , this means solving  Vertex: Let to find . Then plug this value into the equation to find .  After finding these points we can connect the dots with a smooth curve to find our graph!       Graph the -intercept at , the - intercepts at and , and the vertex at . Connect the dots with a smooth curve in a U shape to get our parabola.  Our Solution     If the a in is a negative value, the parabola will end up being an upside-down U. The process to graph it is identical, we just need to be very careful of how our signs operate. Remember, if is negative, then will also be negative because we only square the , not the .       Graph the y-intercept at , the - intercepts at and , and the vertex at . Connect the dots with smooth curve in an upside-down U shape to get our parabola.  Our Solution     It is important to remember the graph of all quadratics is a parabola with the same U shape (they could be upside-down). If you plot your points and we cannot connect them in the correct U shape then one of your points must be wrong. Go back and check your work to be sure they are correct!  Just as all quadratics (equation with ) all have the same U-shape to them and all linear equations (equations such as ) have the same line shape when graphed, different equations have different shapes to them. Below are some common equations (some we have yet to cover!) with their graph shape drawn.    Absolute Value  Cubic                        Quadratic  Exponential                          Square Root  Logarithmic                     Exercises - Graphs of Quadratics    Find the vertex and intercepts of the following quadratics. Use this information to graph the quadratic.                                                                                                         "

  "title": "Function Notation",
  "body": " Function Notation   Objective: Identify functions and use correct notation to evaluate functions at numerical and variable values.   There are many different types of equations that we can work with in algebra. An equation gives the relationship between variables and numbers. Examples of several relationships are below:   There is a special classification of relationships known as functions. Functions have at most one output for any input. Generally is the variable that we plug into an equation and evaluate to find . For this reason is considered an input variable and is considered an output variable. This means the definition of a function, in terms of equations in and could be said, for any value there is at most one value that corresponds with it.  A great way to visualize this definition is to look at the graphs of a few relation- ships. Because values are vertical lines we will draw a vertical line through the graph. If the vertical line crosses the graph more than once, that means we have too many possible values. If the graph crosses the graph only once, then we say the relationship is a function.  Which of the following graphs are graphs of functions?       Drawing a vertical line through this graph will only cross the graph once, it is a function.  Drawing a vertical line through this graph will cross the graph twice, once at top and once at bottom. This is not a function.  Drawing a vertical line through this graph will cross the graph only once, it is a function.    We can look at the above idea in an algebraic method by taking a relationship and solving it for . If we have only one solution then it is a function.        Once we know we have a function, often we will change the notation used to emphasis the fact that it is a function. Instead of writing , we will use function notation which can be written . We read this notation “ of “ ” So for the above example that was a function, instead of writing , we could have written . It is important to point out that does not mean times , it is merely a notation that names the function with the first letter (function ) and then in parenthesis we are given information about what variables are in the function (variable ). The first letter can be anything we want it to be, often you will see (read of ).   World View Note: The concept of a function was first introduced by Arab mathematician Sharaf al-Din al-Tusi in the late 12th century  Once we know a relationship is a function, we may be interested in what values can be put into the equations. The values that are put into an equation (generally the values) are called the domain. When finding the domain , often it is easier to consider what cannot happen in a given function, then exclude those values.     The notation in the previous example tells us that x can be any value except for and . If were one of those two values, the function would be undefined.     In the above example there are no real numbers that make the function undefined. This means any number can be used for .     The notation in the above example states that our variable can be or any number larger than . But any number smaller would make the function undefined (without using imaginary numbers).  Another use of function notation is to easily plug values into functions. If we want to substitute a variable for a value (or an expression) we simply replace the vari- able with what we want to plug in. This is shown in the following examples.           As the above examples show, the function can take many different forms, but the pattern to evaluate the function is always the same, replace the variable with what is in parenthesis and simplify. We can also substitute expressions into functions using the same process. Often the expressions use the same variable, it is important to remember each variable is replaced by whatever is in parenthesis.        It is important to become comfortable with function notation and how to use it as we transition into more advanced algebra topics.   Exercises – Function Notation    Solve.

  "title": "Operations on Functions",
  "body": " Operations on Functions   Objective: Combine functions using sum, difference, product, quotient and composition of functions.   Several functions can work together in one larger function. There are common operations that can be performed on functions. The four basic operations on functions are adding, subtracting, multiplying, and dividing. The notation for these functions is as follows.   When we do one of these four basic operations we can simply evaluate the two functions at the value and then do the operation with both solutions     The process is the same regardless of the operation being performed.     Often as we add, subtract, multiply, or divide functions, we do so in a way that keeps the variable. If there is no number to plug into the equations we will simply use each equation, in parenthesis, and simplify the expression.     The parentheses are very important when we are replacing and with a variable. In the previous example we needed the parenthesis to know to distribute the negative.     Just as we could substitute an expression into evaluating functions, we can substitute an expression into the operations on functions.        The fifth operation of functions is called composition of functions. A composition of functions is a function inside of a function. The notation used for composition of functions is:   To calculate a composition of function we will evaluate the inner function and substitute the answer into the outer function. This is shown in the following example.     We can also evaluate a composition of functions at a variable. In these problems we will take the inside function and substitute into the outside function.     It is important to note that very rarely is the same as as the following example will show, using the same equations, but compositing them in the opposite direction.      World View Note: The term “function” came from Gottfried Wihelm Leibniz, a German mathematician from the late th century.

  "title": "Inverse Functions",
  "body": " Inverse Functions   Objective: Identify and find inverse functions.   When a value goes into a function it is called the input. The result that we get when we evaluate the function is called the output. When working with functions sometimes we will know the output and be interested in what input gave us the output. To find this we use an inverse function. As the name suggests an inverse function undoes whatever the function did. If a function is named , the inverse function will be named (read “f inverse of x”). The negative one is not an exponent, but merely a symbol to let us know that this function is the inverse of .   World View Note: The notation used for functions was first introduced by the great Swiss mathematician, Leonhard Euler in the century.  For example, if , we could deduce that the inverse function would be . If we had an input of , we could calculate . Our output is 8. If we plug this output into the inverse function we get , which is the original input.  Often the functions are much more involved than those described above. It may be difficult to determine just by looking at the functions if they are inverses. In order to test if two functions, and are inverses we will calculate the composition of the two functions at . If changes the variable in some way, then undoes whatever did, then we will be back at again for our final solution. In other words, if we simplify the solution will be . If it is anything but the functions are not inverses.           While the composition is useful to show two functions are inverses, a more common problem is to find the inverse of a function. If we think of as our input and as our output from a function, then the inverse will take as an input and give as the output. This means if we switch and in our function we will find the inverse! This process is called the switch and solve strategy.  Switch and solve strategy to find an inverse:   Replace with   Switch and ’s  Solve for   Replace with          In this lesson we looked at two different things, first showing functions are inverses by calculating the composition, and second finding an inverse when we only have one function. Be careful not to get them backwards. When we already have two functions and are asked to show they are inverses, we do not want to use the switch and solve strategy, what we want to do is calculate the inverse. There may be several ways to represent the same function so the switch and solve strategy may not look the way we expect and can lead us to conclude two functions are not inverses when they are in fact inverses.   Exercises - Inverse Functions    State if the given functions are inverses.

  "body": " Exponential Functions   Objective: Solve exponential equations by finding a common base.   As our study of algebra gets more advanced, we begin to study more involved functions. One pair of inverse functions we will look at are exponential functions and logarithmic functions. Here we will look at exponential functions and then we will consider logarithmic functions in another lesson. Exponential functions are functions where the variable is in the exponent such as . (It is important not to confuse exponential functions with polynomial functions where the variable is in the base such as ).   World View Note: One common application of exponential functions is population growth. According to the CIA World Factbook, the country with the highest population growth rate is a tie between the United Arab Emirates (north of Saudi Arabia) and Burundi (central Africa) at . There are countries with negative growth rates, the lowest being the Northern Mariana Islands (north of Australia) at .  Solving exponetial equations cannot be done using the skill set we have seen in the past. For example, if , we cannot take the - root of because we do not know what the index is and this doesn’t get us any closer to finding . However, we may notice that is . We can then conclude that if then . This is the process we will use to solve exponential functions. If we can re-write a problem so the bases match, then the exponents must also match.     Sometimes we may have to do work on both sides of the equation to get a common base. As we do so, we will use various exponent properties to help. First we will use the exponent property that states .     As we multiply exponents we may need to distribute if there several terms involved.     Another useful exponent property is that negative exponents will give us a reciprocal,      If we have several factors with the same base on one side of the equation we can add the exponents using the property that states .     It may take a bit of practice to get use to knowing which base to use, but as we practice, we will get much quicker at knowing which base to use. As we do so, we will use our exponent properties to help us simplify. Again, below are the properties we used to simplify.   We could see all three properties used in the same problem as we get a common base. This is shown in the next example.     All the problems we have solved here we were able to write with a common base. However, not all problems can be written with a common base, for example, , we cannot write this problem with a common base. To solve problems like this we will need to use the inverse of an exponential function. The inverse is called a logarithmic function, which we will discuss in another section.

The inverse of an exponential function is a new function known as a logarithm. Logarithms are studied in detail in advanced algebra, here we will take an introductory look at how logarithms work. When working with radicals we found that there were two ways to write radicals. The expression could be written as . Each form has its advantages; thus, we need to be comfortable using both the radical form and the rational exponent form. Similarly, an exponent can be written in two forms, each with its own advantages. The first form we are very familiar with, , where is the base, can be thought of as our answer, and is the exponent. The second way to write this is with a logarithm, . The word “log” tells us that we are in this new form. The variables all still mean the same thing. is still the base, can still be thought of as our answer.  Using this idea the problem could also be written as . Both mean the same thing, both are still the same exponent problem, but just as roots can be written in radical form or rational exponent form, both our forms have their own advantages. The most important thing to be comfortable doing with logarithms and exponents is to be able to switch back and forth between the two forms. This is what is shown in the next few examples.   Write each exponential equation in logarithmic form.     Write each logarithmic equation in exponential form    Once we are comfortable switching between logarithmic and exponential form, we are able to evaluate and solve logarithmic expressions and equations. We will first evaluate logarithmic expressions. An easy way to evaluate a logarithm is to set the logarithm equal to and change it into an exponential equation.            World View Note: Dutch mathematician Adriaan Vlacq published a text in which listed logarithms calculated out from to !  Solving equations with logarithms is done in a very similar way, we simply will change the equation into exponential form and try to solve the resulting equation.           There is one base on a logarithm that gets used more often than any other base, base . Similar to square roots not writing the common index of in the radical, we don’t write the common base of in the logarithm. So if we are working on a problem with no base written we will always assume that base is base .     This lesson has introduced the idea of logarithms, changing between logs and exponents, evaluating logarithms, and solving basic logarithmic equations. In an advanced algebra course, logarithms will be studied in much greater detail.   Exercises – Logarithmic Functions    Rewrite each equation in exponential form.

  "title": "Compound Interest",
  "body": " Compound Interest   Objective: Calculate final account balances using the formulas for compound and continuous interest.   An application of exponential functions is compound interest. When money is invested in an account (or given out on loan) a certain amount is added to the balance. This money added to the balance is called interest. Once that interest is added to the balance, it will earn more interest during the next compounding period. This idea of earning interest on interest is called compound interest. For example, if you invest at interest compounded annually, after one year you will earn in interest, giving you a new balance of . The next year you will earn another or , giving you a new balance of . The third year you will earn another or , giving you a new balance of . This pattern will continue each year until you close the account.  There are several ways interest can be paid. The first way, as described above, is compounded annually. In this model the interest is paid once per year. But interest can be compounded more often. Some common compounds include compounded semi-annually (twice per year), quarterly (four times per year, such as quarterly taxes), monthly ( times per year, such as a savings account), weekly ( times per year), or even daily ( times per year, such as some student loans). When interest is compounded in any of these ways, we can calculate the balance after any amount of time using the following formula:         If you take a car loan for with an interest rate of compounded quarterly, no payments required for the first five years, what will your balance be at the end of those five years?    We can also find a missing part of the equation by using our techniques for solving equations.   What principle will amount to if invested at compounded weekly for years    It is interesting to compare equal investments that are made at several different types of compounds. The next few examples do just that.   If is invested in an account paying interest compounded monthly, what is the balance after years?    To investigate what happens to the balance if the compounds happen more often, we will consider the same problem, this time with interest compounded daily.   If is invested in an account paying interest compounded daily, what is the balance after years?    While this difference is not very large, it is a bit higher. The table below shows the result for the same problem with different compounds.    Compound  Balance    Annually  \\$4,919.50    Semi-Annually  \\$4,927.02    Quarterly  \\$4,930.85    Monthly  \\$4,933.42    Weekly  \\$4,934.41    Daily  \\$4,934.67    As the table illustrates, the more often interest is compounded, the higher the final balance will be. The reason is because we are calculating compound interest or interest on interest. So once interest is paid into the account it will start earning interest for the next compound and thus giving a higher final balance. The next question one might consider is what is the maximum number of compounds possible? We actually have a way to calculate interest compounded an infinite number of times a year. This is when the interest is compounded continuously. When we see the word “continuously” we will know that we cannot use the first formula. Instead we will use the following formula:        The variable is a constant similar in idea to pi ( ) in that it goes on forever without repeat or pattern, but just as pi ( ) naturally occurs in several geometry applications, so does appear in many exponential applications, continuous interest being one of them. If you have a scientific calculator you probably have an button (often using the 2nd or shift key, then hit ) that will be useful in calculating interest compounded continuously.   World View Note:  first appeared in in Scottish mathematician’s Napier’s work on logarithms. However, it was Euler in Switzerland who used the letter first to represent this value. Some say he used e because his name begins with E. Others, say it is because exponent starts with . Others say it is because Euler’s work already had the letter in use, so would be the next value. Whatever the reason, ever since he used it in , became the natural base.   If is invested in an account paying interest compounded continuously, what is the balance after years?    Albert Einstein once said that the most powerful force in the universe is compound interest. Consider the following example, illustrating how powerful compound interest can be.   If you invest in an account paying interest compounded continuously for years, and that is all you have to leave your children as an inheritance, what will the final balance be that they will receive?    In years that one-time investment of grew to over one million dollars! That’s the power of compound interest!   Exercises – Compound Interest    Solve.
